## About the State of AI Governance Report

The rapid progression in artificial intelligence capabilities has far-reaching impacts. It has the potential to significantly boost economic productivity, disrupt labour markets, and alter the balance of power between countries. The widespread diffusion of this general-purpose technology presents significant governance challenges that are amplified by the ongoing geopolitical competition for AI dominance.

It is against this backdrop that the Takshashila Institution, an independent centre for research and education in public policy, presents its inaugural State of AI Governance Report. This report provides a systematic comparative analysis of AI governance approaches across different countries, revealing their strategic priorities. Further, the effectiveness of corporate self-regulation initiatives, and the progress of multistakeholder collaborative efforts are also analysed. It concludes by offering predictions in these areas in the coming year.

This annual report will track key developments, analyse trends and offer informed predictions for the AI governance environment. It is intended to provide policymakers, analysts, and interested citizens with insights that help navigate the evolving AI governance landscape.

## Executive Summary

This report analyses AI governance in three contexts – countries, companies and multistakeholder gatherings.

### Countries

- Being at the forefront of AI innovation, the US favours a pro-market regulatory environment while prioritising geopolitical considerations to maintain its competitive advantage.
- The EU has focused on creating a comprehensive regulatory framework that prioritises transparency, accountability, and the protection of individual rights.
- China's approach prioritises national security and favours heavy state control in enforcing regulations and driving innovation.
- India has opted for a light-touch regulatory environment while investing in developing Indigenous AI models for Indian use cases.

### Companies

- Many companies are proactively establishing principles, guardrails and transparency and disclosure norms that guide how they build or use AI. These initiatives sometimes go beyond what is strictly expected by the regulatory environment in which they operate and are intended to build trust with users.
- However, reporting on AI governance efforts by companies is not standardised, and the details of specific initiatives vary considerably. It is also unclear to what extent these efforts involve meaningful external scrutiny. The report analyses the governance initiatives of a few companies operating at different parts of the AI value chain.

### Multistakeholder Gatherings

- Various multistakeholder gatherings, such as the AI Summits and the Global Partnership on AI, have been formed to raise awareness and coordinate AI governance efforts among different countries.
- Although most of these groupings do not have binding commitments or backing from all members (for instance, the US and EU refusing refused to sign the declaration on inclusive and sustainable AI at the AI Action Summit in February 2025). However, they serve as a platform to highlight important concerns and drive convergence in AI governance efforts.

Finally, the report ends with some predictions on what we can expect in AI governance in the coming year.

## Timeline of AI Governance Events

A timeline of significant AI governance events across countries, companies, and multistakeholder groupings is presented below. The timeline focuses only on AI Governance events and does not list milestones related to advancements in the technology.

## Analysis of AI Governance Measures Across Countries

AI governance measures often address multiple objectives. These include ensuring transparency and accountability, promoting innovation, addressing geopolitical considerations, enabling state capacity to implement the measures, and promoting societal well-being.

The authors have analysed and compared the country-specific AI governance measures across these different criteria. There is some subjectivity in this comparative analysis, but the authors feel it is a useful representation of how countries are pursuing these different AI governance priorities.

The United States of America, the European Union, China, and India are selected as countries/regions for comparison. These have been chosen for their significant role in influencing the path of innovation, governance or adoption of AI.

## Analysis of AI Governance Measures Across Companies

Companies are proactively adopting AI governance measures. These measures include developing AI principles, implementing risk mitigation strategies, enhancing transparency and establishing governance structures.

However, there is currently a lack of standardization in how companies report on their AI governance efforts. The specific details of company AI governance initiatives vary considerably.

The extent of meaningful external scrutiny of company AI governance efforts is unclear. It is also challenging to understand how companies are operationalizing their principles, measuring the effectiveness of their risk mitigation strategies, and ensuring accountability.

Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Mistral, Anthropic, Amazon, Accenture, and Deloitte are selected for the comparative analysis. These companies operate across different stages of the AI value chain, including big technology platforms, AI model developers, and technology services firms.

## Predictions

| Confidence | Region | Prediction |
|------------|--------|------------|
| High | Global | Compute thresholds for enforcing regulations will no longer be relevant. The effectiveness of these thresholds might be challenged as a measure of capability as inference computing begins to scale and smaller models become more efficient. The US and EU have 10^26 and 10^25 flops as training compute thresholds for enforcing certain regulations. |
| High | Global | Investments in sovereign cloud infrastructure will increase, driven by geopolitical considerations. |
| High | China, EU | Open-source and open-weight models will continue to be pushed by China and EU as a pathway to strategic autonomy and technology leadership. DeepSeek and Mistral will remain open-weight or open-source. |
| High | India | The compute capacity created under the IndiaAI mission aimed towards incentivising startups and building indigenous models will be underutilised. This is due to lack of demand that meets the criteria to qualify for the subsidies as well as due to friction in the bureaucratic process involved. |
| Moderate | Global | AI governance regulations at the state level will continue to prioritise innovation over encouraging transparency, accountability, and societal well-being. In other words geopolitical considerations will trump protection of individual rights as a governance priority. |
| Moderate | US | US chip restrictions on China will not escalate further. This is because Deep Seek makes owning newer chips less relevant. |
| Moderate | US | Federal laws focused on monitoring AI safety and federal agency assessment of AIs for discrimination and bias will be made defunct or watered down significantly. By the end of the year, AI safety guardrails will be driven by private firms. |
| Moderate | EU | EU's comprehensive regulatory framework, including penalties for non-compliance, would result in a few companies not releasing their AI models/features in the EU. This might lead to a milder enforcement of the regulations. As per the declared timeline, rules on notified bodies, general purpose AI models, governance, confidentiality, and penalties start to apply from August, 2025. |
| Moderate | China | The US Diffusion Framework will not stop state-of-the-art AI models coming out of China, at least not in the next year. This is because Deep Seek makes owning newer chips less relevant, and China has built up an overcapacity of data centres over the past few years. |
| Moderate | India | Regulatory focus will be on protecting the information ecosystem from content deemed harmful for the government or Indian society. |
| Moderate | Corporate | Governance of AI within companies will become a bigger requirement as governments firm up on their positions regarding AI. 'Chief Responsible AI Officer' will be a new role at companies seeking to deploy AI solutions at scale, whose duty it will be to ensure AI is deployed in a manner that will, at the very least, protect them from litigation. |

Confidence reflects how likely the authors believe their prediction will be accurate in the coming year.
