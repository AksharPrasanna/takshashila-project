## Executive Summary 

Internet connectivity is critical to communications, national security
and economic stability, making internet infrastructure a key pillar of a
nation's critical systems.

Satellite internet has emerged as an important part of this information
infrastructure. It addresses the fundamental limitations of ground-based
networks by providing resilient, global internet coverage that functions
regardless of terrain, population density or infrastructure development.
This technology represents not just a backup system but a transformative
approach to internet provision.

Satellite megaconstellations mark a new age in space-based internet.
They involve hundreds or even thousands of satellites orbiting a few
hundred kilometres above Earth. Together, they form a network that beams
internet services directly from space. This 'internet in the sky' has
democratised satellite internet access.

Satellite internet has applications across many domains - military
operations, disaster response, healthcare services, agricultural
productivity, transportation, and public services. The inherently
dual-use nature of satellite internet technology---serving both civilian
and military purposes---creates complex security dynamics.

The potential and risks of satellite internet highlight the need for
strategic investments. It is also important to integrate their use in
disaster response protocols and leverage their potential to bridge the
digital divide. Finally, it is necessary to establish regulation to
tackle security concerns and engage in international forums to shape the
technology's future.

This document represents the first in a planned series examining
satellite internet. It focuses solely on the technological fundamentals
of satellite internet systems, explaining their infrastructure,
functioning, and applications. Regulatory aspects, policy frameworks,
and governance challenges will be addressed comprehensively in future
documents in this series.
