    "section": "Why, What and What Next",
    "text": "Why, What and What Next\nIndia’s problems are scaling faster than the attempted solutions. In every country there is a governance gap—between the economy and its governance—but in our country, the problem is severe, acute and worsening. From telecommunications to finance, from education to agriculture, every sector of the economy needs both specialist domain expertise and management skills. To the extent that India is unable to inject these in its government agencies, it is obvious that we will continue to suffer not only poor governance, but also corruption and injustice.\nAt Takshashila, we have made it our mission to change this. We are acutely aware that the race we are running is marathon, that we will have to run it for decades and the chances that we will succeed are uncertain. Yet, it is a race we have to run.\nWe want to build one of the best schools of statecraft in India. It will be school that is as rooted in India’s civilisational values as it is global in its outlook. It will aim to bring together the best minds in public policy to impart customised, high-quality education to the most promising graduate students. That’s the vision. We have a sense of how to get there, but we do not want start the school tomorrow morning. Since it is to be a school rooted in the Indian experience, we want to scan the length and breadth of the country and build the body of knowledge first.\nYes, this is an audacious project for a bunch of people most of who did not even have greying temples when we started out (and most do not have them even now). So we want to earn our stripes—build credibility even as we validate our own assumptions—by establishing Takshashila as a networked think tank. This is the first step towards realising our vision of an outstanding Indian school of statecraft.\nIt is far more effective to connect talented individuals passionate about changing India for the better into a networked community, than to attempt to hire them and put them in the same building. We do not have the budget for it, and even if we did, we would still stick to the networked model, because we believe it is far more suited to the twenty-first century. [See the Takshashila mission for more details]\nThanks to a substantial initial donation from Rohini Nilekani, chairperson of Arghyam, we could start much faster than we otherwise could.\nSo that’s the preamble. This year was our year zero—the year we got off the ground.\nWe launched our policy research programme and by January 2011, we expect to have more than a dozen fellows. A number of bright younger people have joined us as research associates. Fellows and research associates are spread across the globe, have day jobs and collaborate with each other over the Internet.\nOur Executive Programme on Strategic Affairs (TEPSA) was got off to a start in December 2009, with a full-day programme for senior defence officials, in partnership with the National Maritime Foundation. TEPSA partners educational institutions, think tanks and private companies to train executives on public policy subjects. We will be doing more of these in 2011.\nWe inaugurated our Roundtable Conclave programme last month. Here the idea is to engage civil society by moving high-quality public policy discussions out from New Delhi into the towns and cities of India. We started in Bangalore, and intend to take the programme into other places over the next several months. The idea is to connect individuals who are interested in public affairs to be part of an informed and influential national community.\nAll this, of course, is in addition to our online initiatives at the Indian National Interest (INI) platform of blogs and on twitter. From the time we started, popularity and site traffic has never been our objective. We just wanted to put out the most credible, non-partisan opinion on what we think is in India’s national interest. And we will continue doing so.\nPragati – The Indian National Interest Review, a monthly magazine we started in April 2007, and which Rajeev Mantri’s Quill Media has been distributing print copies of since October 2009, is now into its 46th issue. Like at Takshashila and INI in general, Pragati has attracted a fantastic team of energetic, passionate and committed individuals, and great set of contributors, all working pro bono. From the editorial team to individual contributors, nobody gets paid. Yet Pragati has become one of India’s most well-regarded publications on strategic affairs, public policy and governance. In 2011, we want to increase the circulation of both the digital PDF edition and of the printed copies.\nSince August 2010, I have personally been working on the Takshashila initiative on a full-time basis, thanks to a good friend’s personal sponsorship. I have been fortunate to receive encouragement from a number of people who saw value in what we are trying to achieve. Even so, such a step would be impossible if not for both the support and reality checks imposed on me by my wife…and well, by my children.\nTakshashila needs your help in every one of the areas I’ve written about. We need financial support to build our endowment fund so that we can hire the best graduate students to work on cutting-edge policy research. We need organisers and volunteers across the country to help organise our roundtable conclaves. We need you to subscribe to Pragati, take out gift subscriptions and in general spread the word around.\nIt’s about building an institution that will last. It’s about being a lighthouse that will provide direction to all ships that are willing to navigate by its beacon. Two-and-half millennia ago Takshashila was the intellectual fountainhead not only of Indian statecraft but indeed of all walks of human endeavour. It’s about creating one for modern India."

    "text": "The age of astropolitics has dawned upon the world. A nation’s technological capabilities in space is paramount–economically and strategically. India occupies a very small share of the rapidly growing global space economy. Regulation and production of space activities were hitherto in the hands of the Indian Space Research Organisation. This concentration constricted ISRO’s ability to fulfil the technological needs of the country as well as undertake strategically critical missions. Being among the elite space-faring nations, the number of satellites launched by ISRO is dwarfed by those of the United States and China. The space ecosystem in India needed more participants and the resulting competition to drive innovation and scale.\nAppreciating this need, the Indian government set about liberalising the space arena to stimulate private sector participation. A slew of reforms were announced in 2019 that re-examined the role of the government in the space sector. NewSpace India Limited was established as a commercial arm to take over ISRO’s routine operations through the commercial space sector. Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre was set up to regulate all space activities in India; Government-owned data and infrastructure was opened up to private sector. ISRO’s priorities were repositioned to align with Indian strategic needs. Most recently, the Foreign Direct Invest limits were eased for activities in the space sector.\nExamining some of the other national space policies lends perspective into space sector regulation and growth. The United States of America, Japan and the United Arab Emirates were considered to study three distinct space programs and policy models. The United States follows a “exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build what we must” approach as it seeks to actively leverage the full capabilities of its commercial space industry. It resorts to government production only when procurement from the private sector is unviable. The principles of its space policy has permeated to its various commercial and military procurement policies, space priorities frameworks and space authorisation frameworks.\nThe Japanese follow a similar policy of procurement and partnership to boost its private sector. Having recognised the significance of space for their economy and national security, they are enlarging their space budgets and focusing on building capabilities. The United Arab Emirates has a relatively young space program. The country has made space a priority focus sector. Given its lack of talent and faculty in the field, it is focusing on attracting startups with its friendly regulatory environment and financial incentives. All three nations have enacted a law for space regulation to demonstrate comprehensibility and coherence in their space policies.\nIt is important for India to take the progress and momentum of its space reforms forward by addressing some of the gaps in the policy regime.\n\nIN-SPACe has promotional and regulatory responsibilities that cannot coexist in a single agency. These should be split up. NSIL also faces similar conflicting roles as a promoter and service provider.\nIN-SPACe cannot remain an autonomous body under DoS. It needs independence and separation and should be provided with a statutory backing.\nAs the space regulator, IN-SPACe’s decisions may lead to disputes. The act has to also set up a disputes settlement and appellate tribunal.\nTo give some legal backing to the space policy and establish regulatory certainty in the space ecosystem, the Space Activities Bill must be authorised and enacted by the Parliament on a priority basis. The act should forge a liberal regulatory environment with market-friendly provisions related to space resource utilisation.\nFinally, government procurement will be a key driver in developing the commercial space industry of our country. The Indian government is partial to funding ISRO to build things internally rather than buying from the private sector. In the first case, public funds are spent in building ISRO’s capabilities. In the second, public funds are spent in building the startup industry which can ultimately result in more R&D, job creation and scale.\n\nThe space sector offers enormous potential for development and progress in almost all facets of the society. India must reimagine its approach to this sector by setting its sights not just one ISRO, but on proliferating multiple ISRO like corporations to amass significant space power."

    "text": "Backdrop of the Reforms: The Indian Space Sector\nIn today’s age of astropolitics, space technology is deeply consequential for civilian and military applications. The great powers of the world are vying for control and influence in outer space. The size of the global space economy will triple to reach $1.8 Trillion by 2035.2 Despite being an elite space-faring nation with significant technological achievements, India’s share of this economy is less than 2%.3 The Indian government needed to increase the national space capabilities to occupy a larger share of the global space economy, address India’s growing technology needs and gain an influential voice in the global dialogues related to outer space affairs.\n2 https://www.weforum.org/press/2024/04/space-economy-set-to-triple-to-1-8-trillion-by-2035-new-research-reveals/3 https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/portal-in-portal/satcom/current-size-of-indian-space-economy-is-estimated-around-usd-8-4-billion-jitendra-singh-in-rajya-sabha/105825325This voice needs to be a resonant chorus emerging from diverse stakeholders in the country operating across various domains. This ecosystem was largely missing in India with almost the entire space sector restricted to one organisation. ISRO was single-handedly responsible for both promotion and regulation. The autonomy this extended was beneficial for a nascent space agency during the cold war. However, considering the size and potential of the space economy, this is no longer prudent. The Indian space ecosystem needed new and independent stakeholders besides ISRO. With their entry into the scene, regulatory mechanisms independent of ISRO would follow–enhancing transparency and accountability.\nISRO was also responsible for commercialisation of the space sector. Being the only launch capable space agency, ISRO was tied up with routine tasks of production and operation in trying to sell its launch services to foreign payloads as well as fulfilling Indian launch needs. That left ISRO limited time and personnel for its more strategic objectives related to human-spaceflight, lunar and interplanetary missions.\nEven in its routine operations, ISRO was not self-sufficient. ISRO has grown to a 17,3004 strong organisation and cannot scale disproportionately further, even with weighty resource infusions. ISRO had outsourced parts of its supply chain to the private sector to make up for the limited in-house capacity even before the reforms. While these vendors produced specific components and sub-systems for ISRO, they had limited intellectual property and no end-to-end space capabilities. ISRO has had remarkable successes in its space endeavours and prides itself for its cost-effective space operations. However, the absence of competition from a burgeoning space industry has had an impact on driving scale and innovation up while driving costs down. The American space industry has done just that for the American space sector. India needs a SpaceX of its own.\n4 https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/technology/space-sector-reforms-were-a-bold-move-by-the-modi-govt-former-officials-of-isro-antrix/1005661725 https://nanoavionics.com/blog/how-many-satellites-are-in-space/While human-spaceflight, lunar and interplanetary exploration offer interesting possibilities for the future, almost all of the benefit from outer space is currently derived closer to home–from the satellites in orbit around earth. The number of satellites launched and operated by a nation is a crude proxy for the development and scale of its space capabilities. The number of operational satellites of the US and China dwarves India’s count. The gap grows larger each year.5 ![[Pasted image 20240424153755.png]] (as of May 2023)\nIn the light of this reality, the State realised that it cannot remain a domain exclusive to government agencies."

NSIL’s mandate was also expanded.8\nOn April 6, 2023, the Cabinet Committee approved the Indian Space Policy.9\nOn February 21, 2024, the Government liberalised the FDI policy for space sector.10\n\n6 https://www.nsilindia.co.in7 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=16245368 https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleasepage.Aspx?PRID=16338929 https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/science/cabinet-gives-nod-to-indian-space-policy-2023/article66708202.ece10 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2007876The specifics of the reform can be understood by examining the new roles and responsibilities of NSIL, IN-SPACe and ISRO before reviewing the FDI policy.\n\nNewSpace India Limited\nThe government created NSIL as a Central Public Sector Enterprise under the DoS.11 NSIL was well placed to exploit the commercial opportunities in the space sector by taking advantage of ISRO’s technological faculties through the private sector. This process would also foster the growth of auxiliary industries and infrastructure in India, resulting in positive externalities. \n11 https://www.nsilindia.co.in/12 https://www.nsilindia.co.in/sites/default/files/u1/NSIL%20Annual%20Report%20-%20English%2021-22.pdfInitially, in 2019, NSIL’s mandate was limited to: the production of the PSLV through industry; transfer of  technology; and, providing other space based services. The 2020 reforms that created IN-SPACe also enhanced NSIL’s mandate. NSIL was now tasked with capital intensive functions so as to gradually take over the operational part of ISRO’s missions. In addition to its original functions, NSIL would now build, launch, own and operate satellites as per market demand.12\nIn accordance with its mandate, NSIL has begun end-to-end PSLV production. It has found an industry partner in HAL and L&T consortia for the end-to-end production of 5 PSLVs. From issuing the Expression of Interest for this project in 2019 to the signing of the contract in 2022, the process took three long years. The first of the 5 PSLVs is scheduled to delivered to NSIL by 2024 with significant hand-holding by ISRO.13\n13 https://www.nsilindia.co.in/sites/default/files/u1/Annual%20Report-2022-23%20-%20English.pdf14 https://www.nsilindia.co.in/sites/default/files/u1/Annual%20Report-2022-23%20-%20English.pdf15 https://www.nsilindia.co.in/sites/default/files/u1/Annual%20Report-2022-23%20-%20English.pdfNSIL is offering launch services as well. As of last year, NSIL facilitated the launch of 62 international and 2 domestic commercial satellites aboard ISRO’s PSLVs, including 4 dedicated launches.14 NSIL also commissioned ISRO to build a communication satellite that was launched aboard an Ariane-V rocket highlighting its commercial and demand-driven nature.15\nIn 2022, the Government of India approved the transfer of ownership of 10 in-orbit GSAT satellites to NSIL. NSIL provides satcom services by provisioning transponders across various bands from INSAT/GSAT as well as foreign satellites to Indian users.16 It also handles all the commercial activities of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellites.17\n16 https://www.nsilindia.co.in/sites/default/files/u1/Annual%20Report-2022-23%20-%20English.pdf17 https://x.com/NSIL_India/status/178527315872073735318 https://www.nsilindia.co.in/sites/default/files/u1/Annual%20Report-2022-23%20-%20English.pdfAround 30 technology transfer agreements have also been signed with the industry until 2023.18 In addition to this, NSIL is involved in many other projects and contracts surrounding ground segment and mission support. \n\n\n[Sidenote: Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text]\n19 https://www.nsilindia.co.in/annual-reportIts revenue from operations has grown year-on-year and so have the profits as indicated in the chart below.19 ![[Pasted image 20240429115116.png]]\n\n\nIN-SPACe\nIN-SPACe is an autonomous body under the DoS that acts as a single-window interface for all the space companies and agencies, including ISRO.20 It has a team of 12 members made up of bureaucrats, industry experts, academia, and government officials. They have different departments: Promotion Directorate, Program Management and Authorisation Directorate, Technical Directorate, and the Legal, Finance, and Administrative Wing to handle its numerous responsibilities.21 IN-SPACe’s functions can be categorised into its two main roles - regulation and promotion.\n20 https://www.inspace.gov.in/inspace/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=772aa89787748210de76a8660cbb35e921 https://www.inspace.gov.in/inspace/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=772aa89787748210de76a8660cbb35e922 https://www.isro.gov.in/media_isro/pdf/IndianSpacePolicy2023.pdf23 https://www.isro.gov.in/media_isro/pdf/IndianSpacePolicy2023.pdf24 https://www.inspace.gov.in/inspace/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=772aa89787748210de76a8660cbb35e925 https://www.inspace.gov.in/inspace/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=772aa89787748210de76a8660cbb35e9As a regulator, IN-SPACe is responsible for authorising all space activities by all the participants.22 As its primary responsibility, IN-SPACe ensures that these activities adhere to safety, national security, international obligations, and foreign policy considerations.23 Space-related approvals require the coordination of several departments and ministries such as the Department of Space, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Department of Telecommunication, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Home Affairs, and Ministry of External Affairs. IN-SPACe serves as a single-window interface for this inter-departmental coordination. The Standing Committee for Inter-Ministerial Coordination provides authorisations for applications whenever necessary.24 To make this entire process paperless and seamless, IN-SPACe established a digital platform in 2022, and it has received over 450 applications so far.25\nIN-SPACe has also been tasked with promoting and developing the ecosystem and assisting non-government entities.26 IN-SPACe has to ensure a level playing field in access to all government-owned facilities and satellite data.27 A Price Support Policy has been implemented to offer technical support from ISRO to the private sector.28 \n26 https://www.inspace.gov.in/inspace/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=772aa89787748210de76a8660cbb35e927 https://www.isro.gov.in/media_isro/pdf/IndianSpacePolicy2023.pdf28 https://www.inspace.gov.in/inspace/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=772aa89787748210de76a8660cbb35e929 https://www.isro.gov.in/media_isro/pdf/IndianSpacePolicy2023.pdf30 https://www.inspace.gov.in/inspace/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=772aa89787748210de76a8660cbb35e9IN-SPACe works with industry and academia to enable linkages.29 A total of 50 MoUs have been signed to date with non-governmental entities. To create awareness among academia, a National Committee for Adoption of Space Technology Education was formed. IN-SPACe is partnering with the DoS and the MEA to establish connections between the Indian and foreign space industries. IN-SPACe has already conducted roundtable meetings with Australia, Italy, and Luxembourg and plans to collaborate with more countries in the future.30\nIn-SPACe promotes industry clusters, manufacturing hubs and incubation centres.31 Start-ups can receive up to 1 crore seed fund assistance for funding, training, mentorship, and networking opportunities. IN-SPACe has established a Design Lab and a Technical Centre with computing facilities, test labs and clean rooms that start-ups can use for their mission planning needs.32 IN-SPACe is collaborating with various states in India to develop industry clusters.

IN-SPACe is also in the process of transferring the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) technology to the private industry.35\nThe efforts of the government, IN-SPACe, and the private sector have resulted in a significant increase in the number of space start-ups operating in India, which has risen from 1 in 2012 to close to 200 in 2023. Investments in the Indian space sector have also increased from $6 million in 2019 to $125 million in 2023.36\n36 https://www.inspace.gov.in/inspace/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=772aa89787748210de76a8660cbb35e9\n\nISRO\nThe reforms open up the ISRO’s informational, technological and infrastructural resources to the non-governmental entities. In addition to transferring technology to the private sector via IN-SPACe and NSIL, ISRO has enabled open access of its remote sensing data. Output with resolutions 5 metres and coarser is free and open for all while resolutions finer than 5 metres is free and open for the government and is priced for others. [Sidenote: Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text]\nISRO will shift its energies towards more strategic functions. This would entail ISRO focusing on R&D into technologies critical to the Indian national interest. The Space Policy identifies a few key areas like space transportation, human-spaceflight, in-situ resource utilisation and extra-terrestrial habitability. These technologies aspire for crewed Chandrayaan missions to set up a Indian lunar base in the coming decades.\n\n\nFDI Liberalisation\nOn 21st February, the Union Cabinet liberalised the FDI policy for the space sector. The amendment eased automatic FDI entry thresholds for three sets of activities related to satellite operations.37\n37 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2007876\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet of Activities\n% of FDI entry allowed without Government Approval\n\n\n\n\nManufacturing of components and systems/ sub-systems for satellites, ground segment and user segment.\n100%\n\n\nSatellites-Manufacturing & Operation, Satellite Data Products and Ground Segment & User Segment.\n74%\n\n\nLaunch Vehicles and associated systems or subsystems, Creation of Spaceports for launching and receiving Spacecraft. Beyond 49% these activities are under government route.\n49%\n\n\n\nMost parts of the space operations are capital intensive. Funding is going to remain a challenge for most space companies, particularly the start ups. A large portion of the funding will come from local venture capitalists. As the operations scale, the startups will need a larger and a more patient capital source. The new FDI policy can bring in foreign investors and decentralise investment decisions. However, the Indian industry has to compete globally to attract investments."

The US enjoyed the first movers advantage in the this domain from the space race during the cold war. The legacy space enterprise model in the US wanted the government to own and manage space assets to reduce risk. The US has moved away from this thinking. It presently follows a “exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build what we must” approach as it seeks to actively leverage the capabilities of its private space sector.38\n38 https://www.spaceforce.mil/Portals/2/Documents/Space%20Policy/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy.pdf39 https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ90/PLAW-114publ90.pdfTo facilitate a pro-growth environment for the development of a flourishing commercial space industry and create scope for private sector investment into space assets, the government enacted the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act in 2015. 39\nThe US National Space Policy, 2020 emphasises on encouraging private space entrepreneurship and innovation in order to preserve the American edge in space operations. The US government seeks to actively identify and invest in commercial technologies that can contribute to the State-led space projects. They do not want to inhibit or compete with the private sector. The government will take it upon itself to develop space systems only when there are no viable options for procurement in the commercial space sector and/or in the interest of national security. The government will be inventive and non-traditional in the process of acquiring commercial space goods and services.40\n40 https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/National-Space-Policy.pdf41 https://www.nasa.gov/commercial-lunar-payload-services/42 https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/sp-2014-617.pdf43 https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-partners/44 https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-space/commercial-crew-program/commercial-crew-program-overview/This is evident in NASA’s Artemis program, a key characteristic of it being its industry partners.41 In an effort to build autonomy and competence of its industry, NASA bought end-to-end space services rather than hardware from the space companies.42 43 44\nGiven the strategic imperative of space and the USA’s reliance on the private sector in this regard, the government wants to provide a fillip to the American space companies to stay in the US. The government will also safeguard the companies against predatory foreign investment to retain strategic ownership within the country.\nThe U.S. Space Force Commercial Space Strategy is also in direct support of the U.S. National Space Policy, as are the Department of Defense (DoD) Commercial Space Integration Strategy (2024), United States Novel Space Sector Authorisation and Supervision Framework (2023), and United States Space Priorities Framework (2021).45\n45 https://www.spaceforce.mil/Portals/2/Documents/Space%20Policy/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy.pdf"

National Validated End User (VEU) Authorization\nThis mechanism allows approved institutions in qualifying countries to receive significant allocations of advanced AI chips. For India, this could potentially mean access to up to 100,000 H100s by 2025 and 300,000 by 2027 per approved company.\n\n\n2. One-Time Licenses Mechanism\nBased on country-specific limits, this pathway permits one-time approvals for specific projects or deployments. Under this mechanism, Indian companies might receive approvals for up to 50,000 H100 chips on a first-come, first-serve basis through 2027.\n\n\n3. License Exemptions for Small-Scale Deployments\nThis pathway is designed for smaller applications, typically allowing around 1,700 H100 chips per company. It’s generally meant for non-frontier AI applications and routine deployments.\n\n\n4. General VEU Authorization\nA broader approach that provides longer-term access for established entities with proven compliance records. This represents the primary pathway for Indian companies seeking to build large data centers and will need to acquire chips periodically."
