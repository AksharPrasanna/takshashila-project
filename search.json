    "text": "About the Book\nTo the world at large, technology was synonymous with software. But in 2019, the conversations have changed dramatically. Today, the hardware that runs all software - semiconductors or chips - has become a subject of WhatsApp groups and international politics.\nThe chip shortage during COVID-19 made governments take notice of this complex supply chain. The US began denying advanced semiconductors to Chinese companies. Worsening China-Taiwan relations further intensified the debate. By 2022, China, the US, India, the EU, and Japan had released plans worth billions of dollars for setting up new semiconductor facilities. This book is a comprehensive overview of this “meta-critical” technology. How are semiconductors important from a geopolitical perspective? Why did the US and Taiwan become powerhouses in this domain while Russia and India fell behind? Is China’s semiconductor sector a threat to the world? What are the future trends to watch out for? These are the questions that this book answers.\n\nPurchase Book\n\n\n\nPraise for When The Chips Are Down\n\n“Pranay and Abhiram have put together an excellent framework to understand the past, present, and future of the geopolitics of semiconductors. The book explains why some countries have done relatively better than others and it has learnings for technologists, geopolitical analysts, and policymakers alike.” - Nandan Nilekani, Chairman and Co-founder Infosys and Founding Chairman, UIDAI (Aadhaar)\n\n\n“Pranay Kotasthane, one of the most significant emerging voices in the Indian strategic community, and Abhiram Manchi, explain the new global jousting on semiconductors in this lucid and insightful volume. A must read for all students of India’s geopolitics and technology policy.” - Prof C. Raja Mohan, Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore\n\n\n“If 21st-century conflicts are to be fought at the intersection of technology and geopolitics, this book is indispensable to understanding what chips mean for our future and why India fell off the global semiconductor map at the end of the 20th century. Well-researched and global in its coverage of the history and present realities of chip-making, the authors lucidly explain why China, COVID and indigenous creative talent converge in this decade to offer India a remarkable window to re-join the contest at the cusp of the Indian century—an educative and simply entertaining read.” - Vijay Gokhale, Former Foreign Secretary, Government of India\n\n\n\nNews mentions\n\n$10 Billion Bet: Can India Move Beyond Subsidies In Global Chip Game?\nIn an interview with Outlook Business, Pranay spoke on how current geopolitics create an opportunity for India in the semiconductors sector:\nIndia is a sweet spot from a geopolitical perspective. We will likely see selective international cooperation on semiconductors subject to geopolitical considerations. The semiconductor ecosystem is transnational; it relies on comparative advantages to accelerate innovation. To get ahead of each other, high-technology powers such as the US will likely transfer technologies to their respective partners, provided these strengths are complementary. Such cooperation was recently seen in the AUKUS deal and the iCET announcement on GE jet engines.\nSimilarly, the first major firm to announce the setting up of an assembly and testing facility in India is Micron, an American firm. Provided that India is seen as a trusted partner, the technology transfer will become much easier than it was in the past. Overall, plurilateral cooperation on semiconductors is a necessity, not a choice.\n\nRead Interview\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia mentions\n\nDecoding global semiconductor geopolitics and India’s strategic options\nRecently, Pranay and Abhiram, authors of When the Chips Are Down, appeared on The Hindu on Books podcast to discuss their work on the geopolitics of semiconductors. Listen to the episode here:\n\n\nThe Semiconductor Wars\nPranay and Abhiram also joined Amit Varma on his popular podcast The Seen and The Unseen to shed light on how so much geopolitics today centres around chips — and why it is such a big deal:\n\n\nPranay Kotasthane talks about Semiconductors & Geopolitics\nIn the context of his latest book, Pranay appeared on Shortcast over Coffee to speak about the semiconductor industry, its impact on geopolitics, and India’s foray into semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\nSnippets from #BookLounge at Takshashila with the Authors of When The Chips are Down"

    "text": "I. Introduction\nThe transformative potential of artificial intelligence has captured the world’s imagination. It has been compared to other game changers of the past millennium, such as the Industrial Revolution and the invention of the Internet. Its importance cannot be overstated as a critical technology that can lead to hyper-growth in multiple downstream applications, including those with defence and national security applications.\nAI systems have come a long way since their inception. Simple rule-based systems, where logic and explicit rules were paramount, transitioned into the machine learning era, where past data was used to make future predictions. The advent of deep learning powered by larger datasets and computing heralded a new era, leading to significant advancements in image1 and speech2 recognition.\nFurther advances, such as the development of transformer model architecture3 coupled with improvements in computing and availability of massive amounts of data, have led to the more general-purpose artificial intelligence systems we see today.\nGeneral-purpose AI systems can be adapted to a wide range of applications, including those for which it was not intentionally and specifically designed4 The increase in capabilities is a natural progression in the capabilities of AI systems with the improvements in architectures and the exponential growth in data and computing. Their adaptability to various downstream applications makes them critical and has led to a global race to set the rules for AI5.\nThe current discourse on the risks and potential of AI is largely driven by a handful of dominant technology companies and the media narratives they propagate. The global AI governance efforts are focused on minimising AI’s harmful effects or preventing bias and discrimination in AI systems. While these concerns are important, they often overshadow immediate policy-related questions — the challenge of governing the rapidly evolving AI industry.\n\n\nAI Hype and Doomerism Key Silicon Valley figures, including OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Elon Musk, have called for regulatory measures hyping speculative existential threats. Other experts, however, point out that the real risks are more immediate and relate to the concentration of market power and a lack of accountability.\nThis document focuses on AI governance from a national interest perspective. It focuses on how AI adoption can help humans flourish, strengthen democracy, and promote a stable global order. It highlights the need for sustainable practices in AI adoption and the importance of ensuring competition across all stages of the AI ecosystem. The AI supply chain has multiple stages: data, computation, model, and application. Entry barriers exist at each of these stages. In some instances, many are vertically integrated and controlled by a single company. Competition is vital at the ecosystem level and is also desirable at each of these stages.\nWhile acknowledging concerns around AI ethics and safety, which are the primary focus of governance efforts globally, this document adopts an industry governance approach that can help capitalise on the benefits of AI while mitigating the potential risks.\nThe recommendations in this document are equally applicable to purpose-specific machine learning systems and general-purpose AI systems. Although certain examples specifically mention general-purpose AI models or specific AI applications, the scope of the document covers AI systems in general."

    "section": "II. The AI System Supply Chain",
    "text": "II. The AI System Supply Chain\nThe development of AI systems has inputs such as data, computation, models, and applications as different stages or components in the supply chain. This applies to purpose-specific machine learning systems and general-purpose AI systems. These components can be visualised as layers, with data and computation contributing to the model, which, in turn, supports the applications.\n\n\n\nAI Supply Chain\n\n\nFigure 1: The components of the AI supply chain\nWhile the ideal situation would be to have competition at each stage in the supply chain, in practice, many of these stages are vertically integrated and controlled by a single company. Vertical integration exists when a company controls more than one stage of production or distribution of a particular good or service. It could lead to the creation of entry barriers and discourage competition. \nThe supply chains for AI systems with different levels of vertical integration are illustrated below. These have been shown for general-purpose AI systems but are equally applicable for more specialised machine learning applications as well.\nScenario 1: Fully vertically integrated AI supply chain\nThis supply chain model features a fully vertically integrated entity that owns its computational resources, has access to both public and private proprietary data, and builds and deploys its own AI models and the applications that run on them. \nGoogle exemplifies this level of integration. Their operations span across the supply chain, from having their own chips to access to vast amounts of data, including proprietary data.  They also offer cloud services and have integrated their AI systems into various applications for both web and Android users.\nA variation of this model is an entity that offers a fully integrated system as an “AI-as-a-Hub” service. Third-party models can be used alongside the entity’s own models in this setup. Amazon’s Bedrock serves as an example of this approach.\nScenario 2: Partially vertically integrated AI supply chain\nThis type of supply chain involves a tight coupling between some stages of the AI supply chain. AI developers typically rely on cloud computing resources for training and deploying their models. Most major AI companies have already formed strong partnerships with cloud providers. For example, Microsoft and OpenAI have chosen this approach. They train their models using Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure and make them available exclusively through Microsoft Azure.\nScenario 3: Fully Disaggregated AI supply chain    \nLastly, in a disaggregated model, we can envision a scenario where the computation, data, and AI models all originate from different players that are not interconnected through close partnerships. This supply chain model is often favoured by academia and other open-source AI developers who make their entire models available for replication and deployment. A recent example of this type of disaggregation in the cloud and computing space is Nvidia tying up with the likes of Oracle, Google, and Microsoft to offer its DSG supercomputer as a cloud service for building AI models.6"

    "section": "III. Values for AI Governance",
    "text": "III. Values for AI Governance\nFor each stage of the AI supply chain, from data to application, the authors of this document have identified guiding values to ensure that AI not only advances technologically but does so in a manner that upholds societal and national interests, safeguards democratic values, and preserves our environment. These values are Human Flourishing, Democracy, Stable Global Order, Competition and Planetary Sustainability. We delve deeper into the significance and application of each value in the context of AI governance below.\n\nHuman Flourishing\nAI can greatly improve outcomes in education, healthcare, and governance. These improvements can be particularly impactful in countries with limited state capacity, a common situation in many low-income countries. Effectively designing and implementing public policies over extended periods is a daunting challenge, but AI can augment state capacity to achieve the desired outcomes in these areas. The gains from AI can be similar to the rapid improvement in financial inclusion seen with the adoption of digital public infrastructure such as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India, which allowed leapfrogging by several decades.\nAI is an effective tool to enhance human cognitive capacity and productivity. Its potential to disrupt multiple industries has been likened to the industrial revolution. However, there are also fears about the impact on jobs. An OECD report cautions that 27% of jobs are at a high risk of automation7. These could be in fields as varied as accounting, finance, or medical diagnosis. However, the path of technological advancement is not preordained. AI development can enable growth that is broadly distributed. In this context, there is a growing consensus for AI development to be focused on augmentation instead of automation. This approach aims to empower individuals and organisations by harnessing AI to enhance their capabilities rather than replacing human workers entirely.\n\n\nDemocracy\nAI systems can swiftly process and analyse vast amounts of data, offering the potential for increased government efficiency and transparency. They can simulate policy outcomes and recommend adjustments to ensure optimal results for all stakeholders. Conducting such complex simulations would be exceedingly challenging, if not impossible, without AI.\nAI systems can automate numerous manual verification processes currently involved in responding to inquiries and approval requests within the government. This has the potential to expedite procedures and reduce opportunities for rent-seeking. These systems can also potentially serve as an intermediary between competing groups, conducting in-depth analyses of objections and identifying potentially acceptable solutions to pressing issues.\nHowever, such powerful, opaque, and imperfect systems controlled by a few can lead to externalities that undermine democracy. Several concerns have been raised about the biases inherent in these systems and the potential for misuse8.\n\n\nAI and Bias AI systems are now playing a growing role in determining hiring decisions, access to credit, and even law enforcement. However, due to the imperfect nature of such systems, they can lead to unfair outcomes, exacerbating historical inequalities or discriminating against already marginalized individuals.\nAI systems could potentially be used to create an Orwellian state. The powers to surveil citizens, monitor communications, and stifle dissent at scale can be disastrous for democracy. For instance, such systems have been deployed in China to extend the state’s surveillance capabilities and maintain social control9. Malicious actors can also exploit AI systems to disseminate false information, eroding trust in institutions and potentially influencing the outcomes of elections.\n\n\nHow AI Impacts Democracy AI-powered tools can directly damage public trust in democratic procedures. At its most benign, the automation of legal processes by AI can challenge the transparency and accountability essential to democratic legitimacy. At the other end of the spectrum, AI-driven social bots and deepfakes can sway public opinion by amplifying disinformation and discrediting political opposition.\nThe use and misuse of AI systems could seriously undermine justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. Ensuring such systems are built and used in ways that don’t undermine democracy is paramount. Many minds across the world are busy identifying the risks that AI poses to democracy, but while doing that, we should also ensure that the benefits from AI are not lost to humanity. ### Stable Global Order\nThis represents considerations for safeguarding a state’s interests in a rapidly changing world order. As Pranay Kotasthane notes in his paper on high-tech geopolitics in the post-pandemic world10, technology and geopolitics are increasingly getting intertwined. He observes that trade wars are likely to be tech wars at their core, private technology giants are expected to align more closely with their respective governments, and geopolitical factors will influence international tech collaboration. AI is a critical technology with many downstream applications. Ensuring a diversified supply chain to the building blocks of AI systems is critical to ensuring strategic autonomy.\nAI systems are also increasingly being utilised in military and national security applications. Integrating AI into these areas could lead to an imbalance of power, favouring those who have access to these technologies over those who do not. In the realm of international relations, which often operates on the principle of amoral realism, it is crucial to prevent a situation where the power balance is excessively tilted in favour of a particular adversary.\n\n\nCompetition\nThe AI development supply chain has different stages, such as data, computing, models, and applications. Companies lacking access to any of these stages will struggle to compete effectively. Big tech companies can also leverage their existing market power and insights into user preferences and behaviour to gain a significant advantage in new markets. For large general-purpose AI systems, some stages will also have prohibitive costs, network effects, and economies of scale that benefit entrenched players.\nCompetition drives companies and individuals to innovate and improve. It increases accessibility and choice for end users and is more likely to cater to a broader range of societal needs. Therefore, an effective AI governance framework must ensure competition at every stage of the supply chain and guard against regulatory capture by early movers who have a big lead in developing AI models.\n\n\nPlanetary sustainability\nThe relentless drive among companies to expand the scale of AI systems has resulted in the development of computationally intensive models that depend on massive datasets. The accuracy of these models depends on exceptionally large computational resources that result in significantly high energy consumption11. In addition to the carbon emissions, they consume vast amounts of water for cooling, leading to water shortages12. The environmental impact of training and running such models should be considered in decisions regarding their governance."

    "section": "IV: Desired Outcomes in the AI Ecosystem",
    "text": "IV: Desired Outcomes in the AI Ecosystem\n\nData\n\nOwnership of Data\nLarge technology companies collect and commodify vast amounts of personal data in exchange for the free services they provide users. This model treats data as exhaust from consumption to be collected and used by firms. As a result, we end up with large silos of data controlled by dominant technology companies that employ this data as a moat that hinders competition.\nCreating markets that offer access to comprehensive data repositories on fair terms will be crucial in promoting competition in various aspects of the AI supply chain, such as application development and model development. The key idea behind this market is that data fundamentally originates from individuals, and they are the rightful owners of the data generated through their use of digital services and products. Any companies acquiring, exploiting, or selling this data should be required to obtain the owner’s explicit permission.\nData is the fuel that powers the growth of AI models and applications. Indians consume nearly 20GB of mobile data a month, a three-fold increase from 2018 to 202213.  This is expected to more than double by 2024, with 5G adoption acting as a catalyst. Given this trend, it is clear that India is likely to be amongst the largest producers of data in the world. How India governs the production, consumption and monetisation of its data will impact the AI ecosystem around it. \n\n\nThe Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 The Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 in India regulates personal data governance, empowering individuals (Data Principals) with rights over their data and redefining business practices for responsible data handling by imposing new compliance requirements on Data Fiduciaries and Data Processors. Furthermore, the relaxation of data localisation rules under the Act facilitates cross-border data flows, which influence how foreign players collect and utilise data as they deploy AI technology in India.\nOn the principle that individuals should dictate the usage and distribution of their personal data, we can envision a data marketplace that has the following attributes: - Individuals should be able to dictate if, how, and by whom their data can be used. While it is common practice for firms to aggregate and transform the data they capture for internal and external use, individuals typically lack the means to do the same. India’s Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) and the Account Aggregator Framework built on top of it illustrate a consent-based intermediary system14 to facilitate such a transaction. It allows users to use their financial data from multiple sources to access various financial services for personal or business needs. A similar framework could also be applied to unlock the value of various other data locked in silos for specific purposes approved by the user. Under such a framework, users will also have the option to opt out of their data being used for training purposes.\n\n\nThe Account Aggregator Framework It facilitates the exchange of user data between financial institutions such as banks, insurance agencies, and mutual fund companies, based on user consent. This unlocks user data from silos and allows the market to find competitive solutions to address customer’s needs.\n\nData portability to unlock value for users across markets and also prevent undesirable platform lock-in effects. For example, a seller on one e-commerce platform should be able to transfer their authentic product reviews to another e-commerce platform. Likewise, a user’s health data from a fitness tracker can be shared with their chosen healthcare provider to facilitate the creation of a personalised health plan. Data request templates for different use cases need to be established for various use cases in consultation with stakeholders across industry and academia.\nEnable data provenance and usage transparency. A data aggregation framework also offers information about the origin and lineage of a dataset available within the market. In addition, it can also serve as an audit trail for the downstream models where a dataset is being used.\nEnsuring free and fair access to data is an important outcome to enable a competitive AI ecosystem. A consent-based data aggregation framework will allow firms to create consolidated profiles of users, unlocking data from multiple service providers such as telecom operators, OTT players and others. In addition, governments and large private players should be able to publish datasets to the marketplace.\nIn cases where the data represents the flow of interactions between different users rather than something distinct about a single user, the idea of collective ownership of data can also be implemented15. An example is New York City requiring ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft to disclose data on the date, time, and location of pickups and drop-offs. The city intends to use all this data to understand traffic flow better and plan effectively.\n\n\n\nUnlocking Public Datasets\nHaving data that accurately represents the target population helps reduce bias in algorithms. This is especially evident in fields such as medical diagnosis, where factors like race, gender, and lifestyle can impact disease likelihood16. Assisted diagnosis using image recognition algorithms needs large datasets of labelled images from patients with confirmed diagnoses. Creating such datasets will have positive externalities for research and the AI applications they enable. Governments should invest in creating such representative datasets for use in both research and commercial applications.\nAdditionally, government data often exists in isolated databases, lacking a structured data engineering plan and may not be in a suitable format for training AI models. Thus, there is a need for consistency in data collected from various sources. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, data from healthcare, vaccination, and contact tracing needed to be uniform and available in real-time for designing effective response strategies17. We propose the creation of a sector agnostic entity staffed with data scientists and cybersecurity experts to ensure data uniformity and compliance with best practices. Its mandate would include creating a data engineering plan, conducting audits of different state entities, and enforcing data compliance standards.\n\n\nComputation\nComputing infrastructure, especially when delivered through the cloud, is a vital enabler for developing and adopting AI. It provides access to data storage, processing capabilities, and advanced analytics at scale.  However, the use of cloud computing also presents challenges to the nascent AI industry.  These challenges include potential anti-competitive behaviour by cloud service providers (CSPs), data security and privacy risks, and reliance on foreign-based supply chains for computing resources.\nThe Indian AI industry primarily depends on computing provided by foreign-based CSPs such as Microsoft Azure, Google, and Amazon Web Services18. There is a strong case for India to develop its domestic computing capabilities to mitigate the risks of potential disruptions caused by natural disasters, human-made incidents, or global supply chain disruptions related to AI chips.\nDominant CSPs often have vertically integrated AI supply chains, meaning they might compete directly with their own cloud computing customers. This takes on greater significance in a market like India, where the existing industry mostly sits at the application layer. Even in the application layer, the industry heavily depends on AI models from industry giants like Google or Microsoft. This trend could eventually result in a concentration of market power in both the computing and application layers.\nTherefore, the following outcomes need to be enabled:\n\nFoster a competitive and diverse market for AI cloud service providers by promoting fair competition, reducing entry barriers, and preventing monopolistic practices or vendor lock-ins.\nPromote investments in building domestic capabilities to participate in the global value chain for AI chips and essential computing hardware.\nCreate sovereign computing resources for AI to cater to military and government applications while also serving the needs of industry and academia. This includes GPU/ASIC clusters, data centres, and networks. #### Model\n\nAI systems can drive growth in numerous downstream industries. A competitive marketplace for AI models is vital and can include a variety of distribution models,  ranging from fully proprietary to fully open19. These models can operate on different business strategies, such as pay-for-access like OpenAI’s chatGPT, owning the innovation ecosystem like Meta’s LLaMA, or providing a model that serves as a base for research and innovation, like BigScience’s BLOOM.\nFor AI technologies with broad research and commercial applications, rather than reinventing the wheel, governments should recognise and support established open-source communities by providing grants20. These grants should be provided regularly to fund critical open-source AI projects, whether they are domestic or international in origin. Corporations have also embraced this funding approach, and it has proven to be a sustainable method for sustaining open-source projects. The tangible and intangible benefits gained from this investment would greatly outweigh the costs.\nAI systems designed for image recognition, autonomous driving, and text analysis can have dual-use applications and are important in defence and national security contexts. These systems can operate in hazardous environments and enhance data processing and decision-making capabilities, substantially improving military capabilities. For instance, China has been actively pursuing the development and integration of AI in various military applications as a part of its strategic efforts21.\nRestricted access to such versatile AI technologies, crucial for both economic prosperity and military purposes, poses a significant vulnerability. Thus, in addition to having a vibrant AI marketplace, to the extent that such technologies are dual-use, it is essential to ensure strategic autonomy in access to such systems. Increasing investments in private and public research and development (R&D) is necessary to achieve these objectives. Additionally, establishing centres of excellence that can attract and nurture top AI talent will be essential in reinforcing domestic AI capabilities.\n\n\nApplication\nAs machine learning and AI models continue to improve, applications will increasingly rely on them to deliver new and innovative features. While AI can enhance cognitive capacity and productivity across various sectors, there are also risks in the use and misuse of AI that could seriously undermine democracy.\nAI holds the potential to substantially increase productivity across diverse industries such as education, transportation, agriculture, finance, and customer service. It can also improve transparency and efficiency within government, improve outcomes for citizens and reduce opportunities for rent-seeking.\nHowever, there is a darker side to AI as well. AI systems could potentially be exploited to create a surveillance state, enabling governments to monitor citizens, surveil communications, and suppress dissent more effectively. Additionally, AI systems can be used to spread disinformation and micro-target political advertisements, undermining the functioning of democracy.\nThus, it is essential to adopt a risk-based framework that takes into account the nature of the AI system and the sectors in which they are proposed for use. Adoption of a framework similar to the NIST AI Risk Management Framework22 can better manage the risks associated with AI systems in civilian or government applications. This approach can help strike a balance between proceeding cautiously with high-stakes AI applications while also encouraging innovation."

    "text": "V. Insights Into the AI Ecosystem\n\nData\n\nProprietary Data Offers a Significant Advantage to Vertically Integrated Platforms\nVertically integrated technology firms often have easier access to proprietary data, giving them a significant edge in developing AI systems. Such proprietary data can include social media interactions, code, academic publications, books, and insights into user behaviour.\nFor instance, a video conferencing platform, such as Zoom, can harness customer content generated by its vast userbase to introduce AI-enhanced features, like meeting summaries, thereby enhancing its product23. Similarly, web-based software development platforms like GitHub can tap into their vast code repositories to provide tools such as GitHub Copilot, substantially improving user productivity24. Search engine providers have an advantage in accessing publicly available data on the Internet as they would have built a web index, a sorted and categorised index of web crawl data, which allows them to provide accurate search results rapidly25. Web crawlers of search engines are also less likely to be rate-limited as websites would want to appear in search results, giving companies like Google and Microsoft an advantage in accessing publicly available data26.\nModels trained on high-quality data tend to perform better27. This includes data from sources such as books, academic papers, news articles, and Wikipedia. Studies estimate that for training large language models, such data is likely to be exhausted by 2027. Thus, access to proprietary data can be a key differentiator. Proprietary data may be purchased from different sources, but vertically integrated platforms will have a significant advantage due to easier access to proprietary data.\nBig tech platforms tend to be monopolies or duopolies due to the network effects, which increase the utility of the platforms for users. The scale and insight into user behaviour help these companies innovate better than competitors. This market consolidation is evident across various platforms, ranging from search engines and social media to ride-sharing and food delivery services. Proprietary data is valuable not just to improve the performance of the AI systems but also to improve their offerings by integrating these AI systems. This helps them further consolidate their market power and will be especially useful for vertically integrated platforms.\n\n\nA Marketplace for Data\nWe have become accustomed to the idea of a free online experience. Services such as email, messaging, calling, social media, or video sharing are all enjoyed without direct monetary costs. Users expect these services for free and are not paid for the data they generate on these platforms. The race to capture and monetise the time and attention of users has led to  the widespread collection and commodification of personal data by corporations, what Shoshana Zuboff has termed surveillance capitalism28.\nJaron Lanier argues in his book that although the exchange seems like a barter — free data for free services — it’s problematic. He argues that this approach distorts traditional market evaluation principles, unfairly distributes financial gains from the digital economy, and prevents users from developing themselves into “first-class digital citizens”29.\nWith data being locked in silos controlled by big tech companies, users cannot monetise their data, and other companies cannot compete effectively against these giants. Arrieta-Ibarra et al.30 compare this to an extreme version of a monopsony (a market where there is only one buyer and who, therefore, has control over the negotiations), where users are not even aware of the value of their data.\nRegulatory frameworks, such as the European General Data Protection Regulations and India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, increasingly recognise the ownership rights of the users who generate the data. Creating a market for data and unlocking of user data from these silos can generate huge social and economic value.\nIndia’s Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA)31 is founded on the principle that individuals should dictate the usage and distribution of their personal data. This aims to offer Indians the chance to enhance their own well-being through control over their data. The Account Aggregator Framework is an implementation of this architecture for the financial sector and has the potential to unlock massive value for businesses and end users.\n\n\nCopyright legislation\nIn the United States, the fair use of a copyrighted work is allowed based on the following four factors32.\n\nThe purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is commercial or is for non-profit educational purposes.\nThe nature of the copyrighted work (facts cannot be copyrighted, but creative works can).\nThe amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.\nThe effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nFor instance, Google Books scans entire books for their search engine, but a select few pages are displayed to a user. Courts have ruled that this is not a violation of copyright as the purpose and character of the use are different33. In other words, searching through a book is a transformative use case as opposed to reading the book in its entirety.\nMultiple ongoing legal battles allege that generative AI systems have infringed on copyrighted works. For example, Microsoft and OpenAI are facing a class action lawsuit alleging that the AI-powered coding assistant, GitHub Copilot, indulges in “software piracy on an unprecedented scale”34. Stock photography firm Getty Images is suing Stability AI, the creators of the open-source text-to-image tool Stable Diffusion35. Authors Mona Awad and Paul Tremblay have also filed a similar lawsuit against OpenAI36.\nThe law on these matters is still evolving, and a decision favouring the plaintiffs could reduce the data available for training or lead to higher costs to license such data. These outcomes would favour vertically integrated companies with access to large proprietary databases. This could also pave the way for powerful intermediaries that bundle data licences without adequately compensating the original data creators37.\n\n\n\nComputation\nCurrently, there are two main ways to obtain computing infrastructure. One option is for end-users to buy and set up their own hardware, which can be quite costly. The other option is to use cloud computing services, where providers offer a package of services. The latter is especially alluring for developers or end-users, as CSPs are willing to provide computing resources at deep discounts for AI research and development to firmly entrench their market share as the industry grows.38\n\n\nVertical Integration in the Cloud Services Space Cloud Service Providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform exhibit vertical integration by controlling multiple stages of their service offerings. For example, AWS not only provides cloud infrastructure but also develops its own hardware, such as the Graviton processors, and offers a wide array of services ranging from storage and computing power to machine learning and analytics tools. This integration allows them to optimise performance, reduce costs, and quickly innovate, but also raises concerns about market dominance and competition.\nCloud computing is more than just a technological infrastructure; it is a powerful tool that can break down barriers to accessing technology and essential digital services39. This means that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups can utilise advanced AI tools on par with larger companies, levelling the playing field and fostering innovation. Increased competition in the AI space, enabled by cloud services, leads to more options and improved services for consumers. Consequently, cloud services help prevent the concentration of power and technology in the hands of a select few, contributing to a more balanced global order.\n\nPotential Competition Concerns in Cloud Computing\n\n\nCloud Egress Fees and Customer Switching Egress fees charged by cloud service providers for data transfer out of their networks can significantly impede customers’ ability to switch providers. These ‘hidden’ fees act as a deterrent against leaving a cloud provider’s ecosystem, as they can substantially increase over time, adding to the overall cost of cloud management. While data ingress (moving data into the cloud) is typically free, egress charges apply to data moving out, which can accumulate rapidly, thus elevating IT costs and creating a financial barrier to switching providers. These fees can escalate the costs of managing AI applications and datasets, especially because large volumes of data are involved.]\nAs mentioned earlier, it’s crucial to maintain competition among different cloud computing service providers to ensure affordable and accessible computing resources for the nascent AI industry. The primary sources of these services for a country like India are foreign-based CSPs and hyperscalers. Domestic hyperscalers have not yet reached a similar scale in their operations. One of the main obstacles they face includes dealing with infrastructure challenges that are common in developing countries, such as ensuring a consistent and reliable power supply40.\nThe leading CSPs, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, not only offer computing services but also compete in different stages of the AI supply chain, including models and applications. These CSPs, given their dominant position in the cloud computing market, may hinder competition and innovation in the AI ecosystem. They could do this by imposing restrictive contracts, imposing high switching costs, or unfair pricing on their customers or competitors. For instance, they might charge high egress fees for transferring data out of their platforms, making it challenging for customers to switch to different cloud providers41.\nAdditionally, CSPs could use their access to vast amounts of data and advanced analytics capabilities to gain an unfair advantage in the AI market. They might achieve this by creating or improving their AI products and services or by acquiring or partnering with other players in the AI supply chain. For example, they might leverage their cloud platforms to gather and process data from various sources like e-commerce, social media, or IoT devices and use this data to train and improve their own AI models42.\n\n\nSovereign Computing Resources\n\n\nKeeping Pace with Generational Uplift in Compute Upgrading GPUs is essential for AI developers and cloud service providers, as exemplified by the progression from NVIDIA’s Turing to Ampere architectures. The A100 GPU, built on the Ampere architecture, offers substantial improvements in terms of AI performance and efficiency over its predecessors. These improvements include enhancements in floating-point operations, memory bandwidth, and support for newer technologies like TF32 and mixed precision training, which are highly beneficial for AI and deep learning tasks. This leap in capabilities is crucial for handling more complex AI models and larger datasets, demonstrating why staying current with GPU technology is critical for competitive AI development and cloud service provision.]\nCSPs can also pose a risk to a nation’s data security and sovereignty when they store and process sensitive data of citizens or entities on servers located in other countries, which may be subject to different legal and regulatory rules. For instance, CSPs could be compelled to share or disclose such data with foreign governments or agencies, and they might also be susceptible to cyberattacks or sabotage by malicious actors43.\nAn interim measure seeking to bolster a country’s nascent AI industry to build and train its own models can be to create a publicly accessible supercomputer44.  This involves acquiring a large number of GPUs and allowing start-ups in AI and other emerging technologies that require substantial computational power to rent time slices on this supercomputer45. However, there are some uncertainties associated with this approach. Firstly, current-generation GPUs like the Nvidia H100 are anticipated to be in short supply until mid-2024 due to high demand from almost every player in the AI space. Assuming it is possible to purchase enough GPUs, a generational uplift from the next generation of GPUs will enable faster AI and ML workload processing for those who have them. Time to market is an important consideration for AI companies, and this may be compromised if the only reliable access to computing happens to be slower than what their competitors may have access to.\n\n\nBuilding Domestic Capacity\nIn light of these considerations, it is important to regulate CSPs to achieve the twin objectives of enabling unfettered access to cutting-edge computing resources while building strategic autonomy in computing.\nAt this point in time, where we are still exploring the capabilities of this technology and its ramifications, regulation pertaining to CSPs should adopt a light-touch and enabling approach. This approach should promote competition, diversity, and interoperability while ensuring compliance with data protection and security standards. This could be done by creating an industry-led body responsible for setting and enforcing codes of conduct, best practices, and standards for cloud services, as recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India46.\nAs cloud computing becomes increasingly integrated into various aspects of life, a country like India can leverage its sizeable market and negotiate favourable terms and conditions with foreign-based CSPs. This negotiation can encompass aspects like data localisation, taxation, dispute resolution, and liability clauses. This could be done by creating a common framework that can address the legal and regulatory issues arising from cross-border data flows and jurisdictional conflicts. This framework should also incorporate principles of data sovereignty, data minimisation, data portability, and data security, harmonising provisions from legislation like the Digital Personal Data Protection Act of 202347.\nAnother way to ensure access to compute resources and build strategic autonomy is to invest in domestic production and development of computing resources for AI, such as chips, servers, data centres, and networks. A governance framework should also support research and innovation along with front-footed policy measures such as sandboxes in emerging technologies such as quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, and edge computing, which can enhance the performance and efficiency of AI applications. These measures must be complemented by industrial and trade policy efforts to encourage the involvement of domestic CSPs in the cloud market. This can be achieved by facilitating partnerships with global players48 and offering incentives like tax breaks, subsidies, and preferential procurement policies. As of writing this, most jurisdictions worldwide have taken a wait-and-watch approach to address these potential governance challenges49.\n\n\nSustainable Development\nThe current environmental cost of cloud computing services is significant 50. These services require extensive physical infrastructure, including servers, data centres, and cooling systems, all of which have substantial environmental footprints. The energy consumption of these data centres is immense, primarily driven by the need to power and cool the vast arrays of servers. Attempts to govern an AI industry must attempt to strike a balance between the benefits of cloud computing and planetary sustainability. For instance, states can provide incentives for CSPs to plan server farms that rely on renewable energy like solar and wind power51. Alongside addressing the sources of energy, infrastructure and server efficiency52, it should inform future efforts to decarbonise cloud computing53.\n\n\n\nModels\n\nBridging the Talent Gap\nDeveloping cutting-edge AI systems demands substantial resources in terms of data, computing power, and technical expertise. The industry can mobilise these resources better than academia, and the recent breakthroughs in AI research indicate this - Google’s paper on transformer models54 and Microsoft’s paper on Low-Rank Adoption55. This trend is underscored by the Stanford AI Index report, which reveals that in 2022, industry entities produced 32 significant machine learning models, in stark contrast to academia, which contributed only three56.\nData and computing are vital components in the training of AI systems. We delve deeper into the challenges and obstacles related to these domains in the sections focused on data and computing.\nIn their paper discussing India’s AI potential, Chahal et al. highlight some key observations57. India produces nearly twice as many master’s level engineering graduates as the United States, second only to China in this regard. However, India significantly lags behind the United States in producing PhDs, with less than one-third of the number. The shortcomings within India’s higher education sector limit its ability to offer extensive training for a highly skilled AI workforce. Consequently, many Indian students opt to pursue PhD programs in foreign countries. The ASPI critical technology tracker clearly shows the brain drain of Indian AI talent to other countries, notably the United States58.\nIndian researchers publish AI-related papers at a prolific rate, trailing only behind the United States and China. However, when ranked by H-index, which measures both the productivity and citation impact of publications, India descends to the 16th position, indicating that the quality of these publications falls short of expectations59.\nIndia’s research and development (R&D) investment is a mere 0.64% of its GDP, significantly lower than that of other nations60. Of this amount, approximately 37% comes from the private sector. In contrast, China allocates 2.4% of its GDP to R&D, and most developed countries devote more than 2% of their GDP to research and development. Switzerland, which topped the Global Innovation Index in 2022, spends 3.19% of its GDP on R&D. This implies that India’s scientific research in AI is likely underfunded compared to many other countries.\nOn a positive note, according to a report from Bain & Company, India stands out as a significant global source of talent in data and AI skills61. It contributes 16% of the world’s AI talent pool, ranking it among the top three talent markets worldwide. However, not all AI talent is equal. Top-tier AI researchers are involved in creating intellectual property or designing and training AI algorithms, which are activities at the top of the value chain. A study by MacroPolo, a US-based think tank, finds that over 80% of India’s top-tier AI researchers move out of the country62. Consequently, while the specialised skills required for research and training AI models may be in shorter supply, India still holds a substantial advantage in engineering, which is likely also an advantage in developing applications based on AI models.\n\n\nThe Real Risks of General Purpose AI Models\nA handful of companies, such as Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta, have a big lead in developing general-purpose AI models. A race is on to build these powerful AI systems and lock in the early mover advantages. Top executives from Microsoft and OpenAI have called for an agency to regulate AI and licensing requirements to operate the most powerful AI tools63.\nAn open letter by the Future of Life Institute supported by over 1,000 researchers, technologists and public figures has asked for a 6-month pause on training language models “more powerful than” GPT-464. The letter presents risks of malicious use, job impact, and existential risks as serious consequences of embracing AI. However, as the authors of the book project AI Snake Oil point out65, the letter exaggerates hypothetical risks and ignores the real issues around over-reliance on inaccurate tools, centralisation of power by these companies, and near-term security risks. An effective governance framework for AI should be able to address the significant challenges that come with AI adoption and not fall prey to the narratives peddled by various interest groups.\n\n\nThe Gradients of Openness in ‘Open’ AI Systems\nThe release practices of ‘open’ AI systems differ significantly from those of open-source software. There are varying degrees of openness in how AI systems are released. A study conducted by Radboud University researchers reveals the large variation in the availability, documentation, and accessibility across different AI models66. Additionally, unlike open-source software, significant access barriers in data and computing exist even in the fully open models.\nIrene Solaiman’s paper67 introduces a framework for grading the openness of generative AI systems. Generative AI systems are a sub-type of general-purpose AI models that generate content based on user inputs, often across different modalities such as text, images or video. The framework classifies them into six gradients of access: fully closed, gradual or staged access, hosted access, cloud-based or API access, downloadable access, and fully open. This classification helps to understand the extent to which these systems are accessible to users and developers.\n\nFigure 2: Source: The Gradient of Generative AI Release, Solaiman, 2023\nWith the fully open models, controls against misuse will be harder to enforce. However, they provide the reproducibility and independence from corporate decisions that are necessary for research purposes. One of the most widely used fully open models is BLOOM68. It is a multilingual language model built by over 1,000 researchers from 70+ countries to overcome the access barriers that academia, nonprofits or research labs face to create, study, and use LLMs.\nHowever, for most downstream applications, the various levels of convenience, customisation, ownership, and safeguards against misuse offered by hosted access, API access, or downloadable models will prove to be satisfactory. The model type selection will ultimately hinge on the trade-offs among these diverse criteria.\nAnother important consideration is that big tech companies also have vested interests in ‘open’ AI development. As a leaked memo by a Google researcher points out69, “owning the ecosystem” is extremely valuable. This strategy is similar to what Google has done with Chrome and Android. He states that “by owning the platform where innovation happens, Google cements itself as a thought leader and direction-setter, earning the ability to shape the narrative on ideas that are larger than itself”.\nThis is true of the dominant AI development frameworks PyTorch and TensorFlow, developed by Meta and Google, respectively, both of which are open-source. These companies continue to maintain them, and most AI models are trained on one of these frameworks70. Meta’s downloadable model, LLaMA71, is also an effort at “owning the ecosystem”.\n\n\nIs Bigger Always Better for AI Systems?\nLarge language models have seen a massive increase in size and training data in the pursuit of better performance. Leading models such as PaLM and GPT4 use hundreds of billions of parameters and are trained on vast and varied datasets72. Bender et al. have raised concerns about the dangers of these massive models, coining the term “stochastic parrots”73. They point out the huge environmental, financial, and opportunity costs of pursuing research in a technology with many risks involved.\nHowever, questions remain about the long-term sustainability of continually increasing model sizes:\n\nLimited availability of extensive high-quality datasets, diminishing returns from scaling up model size, and constraints on computing resources might affect the motivation or capability to develop even larger AI models74.\nThe costs of operating bigger models might be too high for most users, leading to a preference for more compact models. Market trends already indicate a focus on reducing the total cost of ownership of these models75.\nIn many business scenarios, an acceptable performance might be sufficient without needing cutting-edge accuracy.\n\nPurpose-specific machine learning models might be more reliable and equally effective for many applications. However, if the performance of general-purpose AI models scales with size and data, it could lead to the wider adoption of larger models. As a result, building these models will likely become the domain of a few large players.\n\n\n\nApplication\nAddressing concerns in other stages of the AI ecosystem will pave the way for the market to address the requirements of the application layer effectively. Competition issues at the data, computation or model stages could hinder innovation at the application stage.\nFor instance, ensuring unfettered access to diverse datasets can empower smaller players to compete effectively with dominant firms that have access to proprietary datasets. Regulating cloud service providers can prevent dominant firms from abusing their market power to favour their own applications over others. By making compute resources affordable and accessible, smaller firms can innovate on par with larger players. Finally, a competitive market for AI models will lead to reduced costs, increased innovation, and more choices for application developers.  When concerns in other stages are properly addressed, it will enable a wider variety of applications catering to diverse needs.\nIn addressing the AI application layer, we emphasise a risk-based governance approach. This involves identifying potential risks such as data privacy, security, and ethical concerns and incorporating trustworthiness into AI design and use. Compliance with global standards, like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework76, can guide this process.\nRegular stakeholder engagement is crucial, including feedback from developers, end-users, and regulators. This ensures the framework remains relevant and effective. Additionally, periodic reviews and updates will align the governance model with evolving technologies and market dynamics, fostering a competitive and innovative AI application landscape."

It’s not just the domain of technology or finance ministries; national security experts and geopolitical policy analysts also focus on it. In a working paper, Pranay Kotasthane highlights several key trends77 :\n\nTrade wars are likely to be tech wars at their core\nAggressive national competition over high technology might produce some nonlinear breakthroughs this decade\nThere will be higher alignment between private high-technology players and their national governments\nWe will likely encounter selective international cooperation on high-technology subject to geopolitical considerations\n\nThe paper also introduces a framework to understand how nations might use political and economic tools to achieve strategic goals in high-tech sectors.\n\nFigure 3: A framework for High-technology Geopolitics. Source: The Takshashila Institution78. ### An Overview of The AI Chips Market\nDevelopment and deployment of general-purpose AI models and other AI/ML applications require high-speed and parallelised calculations that conventional general-purpose CPUs cannot perform well. At the same time, because of the large amount of data required to train the models, extremely fast and high bandwidth memory also needs to be part of the computing process. Specialised memory utilised in AI accelerator chips/GPUs offers more than 4.5 times the bandwidth of conventional memory.79 AI developers and machine learning researchers take advantage of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which offer both these capabilities (originally intended for image processing) to speed up computational tasks.80.\nAlongside GPUs, a set of AI accelerator chips is also designed for specific kinds of AI/ML and deep learning workloads. Both types of accelerator chips are deployed in hundreds of numbers for pre-training foundational models.81.\nCompute resources are required at two stages of the layer-based model we propose: at the training/development level and, subsequently, the inference/application level.\nThe number of parameters of a particular model determines the extent of the compute resource required for pre-training and inference 82. Compute costs and power requirements increase exponentially as the size of models grows83.\n\nFigure 4: Source: UK CMA AI Foundation Models: Initial Report84\nThe compute costs for training models are not public, but it is estimated that the largest Foundation model on the market (GPT-4) costs USD 100 million to train 85. Inference costs are estimated to be around USD 700,000 a day.86 Developers who are not already vertically integrated and want to avoid bearing the huge upfront costs required to build the computation infrastructure prefer to contract the services of CSPs. CSPs allow access to both general-purpose and AI/ML workload-specific computing resources, including CPU, GPU and storage, on contractual terms through the cloud.\nThe core of the market share for AI accelerator chips belongs to Nvidia, which accounts for 91.4% of the enterprise GPU market87 . Both vertically integrated developers of AI models and CSPs purchase Nvidia GPUs for AI-specific workloads. The reason for this huge concentration of market power is the proliferation and development of CUDA88, a proprietary general-purpose computing platform and programming model owned by Nvidia that allowed developers to make GPU-specific applications89. Since its inception in 2007, its ease of use saw its adoption in teaching curriculums across universities worldwide, as well as extensive use in the scientific research sector, which leveraged parallel computing offered by GPUs, which were relatively cheap when compared to renting supercomputer services. The network effects of CUDA becoming the de facto standard in programming to program GPU-specific applications meant that researchers tended to be locked into using Nvidia’s chips as well since CUDA is difficult to port90. The closest competitor, AMD, has lower-priced offerings but, so far, has not been able to effectively combat Nvidia’s first-mover advantage and technological lead91.\nThere is also a qualitative difference between compute requirements needed for training and inference-based workloads, respectively. The former’s considerations of accuracy, ability to crunch large datasets parallelly, and training speed require significantly more raw computational power, memory capacity, and networking capabilities deployed over a large number of nodes (number of chips), which are utilised to nearly 100 per cent for long periods of time92. This also necessitates significant cooling capacity and high sustained power draw. Training workloads generally leverage GPUs, manufactured using cutting-edge fabrication technology93, with Nvidia being the market leader in this segment94. This segment reportedly accounts for around 20% of the demand for AI chips95.\nCompute infrastructure needed for inference-based workloads prioritises latency and throughput as opposed to raw computational power and hence needs high-capacity fast memory and high bandwidth I/O channels96. Most inference workloads are performed on traditional CPUs, supplemented by GPUs, ASICs, and FPGAs97. However, inference workloads are also fragmented between processing in both edge and cloud environments.\nCloud inference leverages the AI chips mentioned earlier and is provided as a service by CSPs. The market for this is reportedly large and fragmented due to the varied nature of the chips being used; however, Nvidia is likely to have a significant share here as well since GPUs can be easily programmed to move from training to inference workloads. However, even with a supply shortage for GPUs, CSPs are deploying their own proprietary chips (Google’s TPU, for ex.), and plentifully available CPUs to run inference workloads. Therefore, this market segment is anticipated to be highly competitive98.\nInference at the edge leverages chips or parts of SoCs in end-user devices like smartphones, cameras, and cars. While devices like smartphones tend to have SoCs built on leading-edge chips, most other devices utilise chips that can be made on mature fabrication processes. They are designed to use low power and to be cheap.99 This market will also likely remain highly fragmented, with Qualcomm, Intel and AMD continuing to provide chips for certain device categories like phones and laptops, but a wide range of companies exist to cater to various kinds of devices100.\nGoogle’s TPU is an example of a custom-designed accelerator chip that is optimised for both training and inference workloads101.\n\n\nCharacteristics of AI Chips Supply Chain\nThe supply chain for GPUs, as well as other AI accelerator chips and High Bandwidth Memory, is controlled by a select few countries that are dominant in the semiconductor global value chain(GVC), like Taiwan, South Korea, and the USA102. The technology, human capital, raw material and other inputs required to manufacture these highly specialised and intricate chips are spread out over these countries across a handful of companies at each stage of the value chain. Due to the hyper-globalised and specialised nature of the GVC, any disruption in the supply can severely affect the availability of chips for the end consumers. This dependency on a foreign entity-controlled supply chain can also become a strategic vulnerability, and foreign nations can potentially restrict access to any part of the supply chain.\nThe supply chain for other kinds of AI chips can be broadly divided into two categories: chips intended for training or inference workloads. The former, like GPUs, are controlled by a handful of companies and countries. Integration into the GVC for these chips or creating a domestic ecosystem to manufacture homegrown alternatives will take immense financial expenditure over a long period to bear fruit103. On the other hand, inference chips can be more easily manufactured domestically, with architectures like RISC-V lending themselves well to AI inference workloads.104 In this segment, policy intervention to ensure low entry barriers for domestic industry can happen via revamping trade policy to allow for a freer influx of input material and components required to manufacture such chips combined with industrial policies that enable the establishment of fabrication foundries on lower-cost mature processes which can tap into India’s existing chip design talent pool105."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The age of astropolitics has dawned upon the world. A nation’s technological capabilities in space is paramount–economically and strategically. India occupies a very small share of the rapidly growing global space economy. Regulation and production of space activities were hitherto in the hands of the Indian Space Research Organisation. This concentration constricted ISRO’s ability to fulfil the technological needs of the country as well as undertake strategically critical missions. Being among the elite space-faring nations, the number of satellites launched by ISRO is dwarfed by those of the United States and China. The space ecosystem in India needed more participants and the resulting competition to drive innovation and scale.\nAppreciating this need, the Indian government set about liberalising the space arena to stimulate private sector participation. A slew of reforms were announced in 2019 that re-examined the role of the government in the space sector. NewSpace India Limited was established as a commercial arm to take over ISRO’s routine operations through the commercial space sector. Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre was set up to regulate all space activities in India; Government-owned data and infrastructure was opened up to private sector. ISRO’s priorities were repositioned to align with Indian strategic needs. Most recently, the Foreign Direct Invest limits were eased for activities in the space sector.\nExamining some of the other national space policies lends perspective into space sector regulation and growth. The United States of America, Japan and the United Arab Emirates were considered to study three distinct space programs and policy models. The United States follows a “exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build what we must” approach as it seeks to actively leverage the full capabilities of its commercial space industry. It resorts to government production only when procurement from the private sector is unviable. The principles of its space policy has permeated to its various commercial and military procurement policies, space priorities frameworks and space authorisation frameworks.\nThe Japanese follow a similar policy of procurement and partnership to boost its private sector. Having recognised the significance of space for their economy and national security, they are enlarging their space budgets and focusing on building capabilities. The United Arab Emirates has a relatively young space program. The country has made space a priority focus sector. Given its lack of talent and faculty in the field, it is focusing on attracting startups with its friendly regulatory environment and financial incentives. All three nations have enacted a law for space regulation to demonstrate comprehensibility and coherence in their space policies.\nIt is important for India to take the progress and momentum of its space reforms forward by addressing some of the gaps in the policy regime.\n\nIN-SPACe has promotional and regulatory responsibilities that cannot coexist in a single agency. These should be split up. NSIL also faces similar conflicting roles as a promoter and service provider.\nIN-SPACe cannot remain an autonomous body under DoS. It needs independence and separation and should be provided with a statutory backing.\nAs the space regulator, IN-SPACe’s decisions may lead to disputes. The act has to also set up a disputes settlement and appellate tribunal.\nTo give some legal backing to the space policy and establish regulatory certainty in the space ecosystem, the Space Activities Bill must be authorised and enacted by the Parliament on a priority basis. The act should forge a liberal regulatory environment with market-friendly provisions related to space resource utilisation.\nFinally, government procurement will be a key driver in developing the commercial space industry of our country. The Indian government is partial to funding ISRO to build things internally rather than buying from the private sector. In the first case, public funds are spent in building ISRO’s capabilities. In the second, public funds are spent in building the startup industry which can ultimately result in more R&D, job creation and scale.\n\nThe space sector offers enormous potential for development and progress in almost all facets of the society. India must reimagine its approach to this sector by setting its sights not just one ISRO, but on proliferating multiple ISRO like corporations to amass significant space power."

    "text": "Backdrop of the Reforms: The Indian Space Sector\nIn today’s age of astropolitics, space technology is deeply consequential for civilian and military applications. The great powers of the world are vying for control and influence in outer space. The size of the global space economy will triple to reach $1.8 Trillion by 2035.2 Despite being an elite space-faring nation with significant technological achievements, India’s share of this economy is less than 2%.3 The Indian government needed to increase the national space capabilities to occupy a larger share of the global space economy, address India’s growing technology needs and gain an influential voice in the global dialogues related to outer space affairs.\nThis voice needs to be a resonant chorus emerging from diverse stakeholders in the country operating across various domains. This ecosystem was largely missing in India with almost the entire space sector restricted to one organisation. ISRO was single-handedly responsible for both promotion and regulation. The autonomy this extended was beneficial for a nascent space agency during the cold war. However, considering the size and potential of the space economy, this is no longer prudent. The Indian space ecosystem needed new and independent stakeholders besides ISRO. With their entry into the scene, regulatory mechanisms independent of ISRO would follow–enhancing transparency and accountability.\nISRO was also responsible for commercialisation of the space sector. Being the only launch capable space agency, ISRO was tied up with routine tasks of production and operation in trying to sell its launch services to foreign payloads as well as fulfilling Indian launch needs. That left ISRO limited time and personnel for its more strategic objectives related to human-spaceflight, lunar and interplanetary missions.\nEven in its routine operations, ISRO was not self-sufficient. ISRO has grown to a 17,3004 strong organisation and cannot scale disproportionately further, even with weighty resource infusions. ISRO had outsourced parts of its supply chain to the private sector to make up for the limited in-house capacity even before the reforms. While these vendors produced specific components and sub-systems for ISRO, they had limited intellectual property and no end-to-end space capabilities. ISRO has had remarkable successes in its space endeavours and prides itself for its cost-effective space operations. However, the absence of competition from a burgeoning space industry has had an impact on driving scale and innovation up while driving costs down. The American space industry has done just that for the American space sector. India needs a SpaceX of its own.\nWhile human-spaceflight, lunar and interplanetary exploration offer interesting possibilities for the future, almost all of the benefit from outer space is currently derived closer to home–from the satellites in orbit around earth. The number of satellites launched and operated by a nation is a crude proxy for the development and scale of its space capabilities. The number of operational satellites of the US and China dwarves India’s count. The gap grows larger each year.5 ![[Pasted image 20240424153755.png]] (as of May 2023)\nIn the light of this reality, the State realised that it cannot remain a domain exclusive to government agencies."

    "text": "The Space Sector is undergoing Reform\nThe reforms were doled out in stages through a gradual process that began in 2019 and is still ongoing:\n\nOn March 6, 2019, NSIL was incorporated to take over ISRO’s commercial role.6\nOn May 16, 2020, the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the government’s intention to reform the Indian space sector.7\nOn June 24, 2020, the Union Cabinet approved the reforms and created IN-SPACe. NSIL’s mandate was also expanded.8\nOn April 6, 2023, the Cabinet Committee approved the Indian Space Policy.9\nOn February 21, 2024, the Government liberalised the FDI policy for space sector.10\n\nThe specifics of the reform can be understood by examining the new roles and responsibilities of NSIL, IN-SPACe and ISRO before reviewing the FDI policy.\n\nNewSpace India Limited\nThe government created NSIL as a Central Public Sector Enterprise under the DoS.11 NSIL was well placed to exploit the commercial opportunities in the space sector by taking advantage of ISRO’s technological faculties through the private sector. This process would also foster the growth of auxiliary industries and infrastructure in India, resulting in positive externalities. \nInitially, in 2019, NSIL’s mandate was limited to: the production of the PSLV through industry; transfer of  technology; and, providing other space based services. The 2020 reforms that created IN-SPACe also enhanced NSIL’s mandate. NSIL was now tasked with capital intensive functions so as to gradually take over the operational part of ISRO’s missions. In addition to its original functions, NSIL would now build, launch, own and operate satellites as per market demand.12\nIn accordance with its mandate, NSIL has begun end-to-end PSLV production. It has found an industry partner in HAL and L&T consortia for the end-to-end production of 5 PSLVs. From issuing the Expression of Interest for this project in 2019 to the signing of the contract in 2022, the process took three long years. The first of the 5 PSLVs is scheduled to delivered to NSIL by 2024 with significant hand-holding by ISRO.13\nNSIL is offering launch services as well. As of last year, NSIL facilitated the launch of 62 international and 2 domestic commercial satellites aboard ISRO’s PSLVs, including 4 dedicated launches.14 NSIL also commissioned ISRO to build a communication satellite that was launched aboard an Ariane-V rocket highlighting its commercial and demand-driven nature.15\nIn 2022, the Government of India approved the transfer of ownership of 10 in-orbit GSAT satellites to NSIL. NSIL provides satcom services by provisioning transponders across various bands from INSAT/GSAT as well as foreign satellites to Indian users.16 It also handles all the commercial activities of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellites.17\nAround 30 technology transfer agreements have also been signed with the industry until 2023.18 In addition to this, NSIL is involved in many other projects and contracts surrounding ground segment and mission support. \n\n\nSample Text Link\nIts revenue from operations has grown year-on-year and so have the profits as indicated in the chart below.19 ![[Pasted image 20240429115116.png]]\n\n\nIN-SPACe\nIN-SPACe is an autonomous body under the DoS that acts as a single-window interface for all the space companies and agencies, including ISRO.20 It has a team of 12 members made up of bureaucrats, industry experts, academia, and government officials. They have different departments: Promotion Directorate, Program Management and Authorisation Directorate, Technical Directorate, and the Legal, Finance, and Administrative Wing to handle its numerous responsibilities.21 IN-SPACe’s functions can be categorised into its two main roles - regulation and promotion.\nAs a regulator, IN-SPACe is responsible for authorising all space activities by all the participants.22 As its primary responsibility, IN-SPACe ensures that these activities adhere to safety, national security, international obligations, and foreign policy considerations.23 Space-related approvals require the coordination of several departments and ministries such as the Department of Space, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Department of Telecommunication, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Home Affairs, and Ministry of External Affairs. IN-SPACe serves as a single-window interface for this inter-departmental coordination. The Standing Committee for Inter-Ministerial Coordination provides authorisations for applications whenever necessary.24 To make this entire process paperless and seamless, IN-SPACe established a digital platform in 2022, and it has received over 450 applications so far.25\nIN-SPACe has also been tasked with promoting and developing the ecosystem and assisting non-government entities.26 IN-SPACe has to ensure a level playing field in access to all government-owned facilities and satellite data.27 A Price Support Policy has been implemented to offer technical support from ISRO to the private sector.28 \nIN-SPACe works with industry and academia to enable linkages.29 A total of 50 MoUs have been signed to date with non-governmental entities. To create awareness among academia, a National Committee for Adoption of Space Technology Education was formed. IN-SPACe is partnering with the DoS and the MEA to establish connections between the Indian and foreign space industries. IN-SPACe has already conducted roundtable meetings with Australia, Italy, and Luxembourg and plans to collaborate with more countries in the future.30\nIn-SPACe promotes industry clusters, manufacturing hubs and incubation centres.31 Start-ups can receive up to 1 crore seed fund assistance for funding, training, mentorship, and networking opportunities. IN-SPACe has established a Design Lab and a Technical Centre with computing facilities, test labs and clean rooms that start-ups can use for their mission planning needs.32 IN-SPACe is collaborating with various states in India to develop industry clusters. One such recent collaboration was with Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation Limited (TIDCO) to establish a space industrial and propellants park.33 Another partnership exists with Gujarat to construct a space manufacturing park.34\nIN-SPACe also facilitates technology transfers to non-governmental entities. Fifteen technologies developed by ISRO have already been transferred to private companies. Private companies can apply for technology transfer through the website. IN-SPACe is also in the process of transferring the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) technology to the private industry.35\nThe efforts of the government, IN-SPACe, and the private sector have resulted in a significant increase in the number of space start-ups operating in India, which has risen from 1 in 2012 to close to 200 in 2023. Investments in the Indian space sector have also increased from $6 million in 2019 to $125 million in 2023.36\n\n\nISRO\nThe reforms open up the ISRO’s informational, technological and infrastructural resources to the non-governmental entities. In addition to transferring technology to the private sector via IN-SPACe and NSIL, ISRO has enabled open access of its remote sensing data. Output with resolutions 5 metres and coarser is free and open for all while resolutions finer than 5 metres is free and open for the government and is priced for others. [Sidenote: Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text Sample text]\nISRO will shift its energies towards more strategic functions. This would entail ISRO focusing on R&D into technologies critical to the Indian national interest. The Space Policy identifies a few key areas like space transportation, human-spaceflight, in-situ resource utilisation and extra-terrestrial habitability. These technologies aspire for crewed Chandrayaan missions to set up a Indian lunar base in the coming decades.\n\n\nFDI Liberalisation\nOn 21st February, the Union Cabinet liberalised the FDI policy for the space sector. The amendment eased automatic FDI entry thresholds for three sets of activities related to satellite operations.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet of Activities\n% of FDI entry allowed without Government Approval\n\n\n\n\nManufacturing of components and systems/ sub-systems for satellites, ground segment and user segment.\n100%\n\n\nSatellites-Manufacturing & Operation, Satellite Data Products and Ground Segment & User Segment.\n74%\n\n\nLaunch Vehicles and associated systems or subsystems, Creation of Spaceports for launching and receiving Spacecraft. Beyond 49% these activities are under government route.\n49%\n\n\n\nMost parts of the space operations are capital intensive. Funding is going to remain a challenge for most space companies, particularly the start ups. A large portion of the funding will come from local venture capitalists. As the operations scale, the startups will need a larger and a more patient capital source. The new FDI policy can bring in foreign investors and decentralise investment decisions. However, the Indian industry has to compete globally to attract investments."

    "text": "USA\nThe American space ecosystem is the largest in the world in terms of scale and capabilities. The US enjoyed the first movers advantage in the this domain from the space race during the cold war. The legacy space enterprise model in the US wanted the government to own and manage space assets to reduce risk. The US has moved away from this thinking. It presently follows a “exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build what we must” approach as it seeks to actively leverage the capabilities of its private space sector.38\nTo facilitate a pro-growth environment for the development of a flourishing commercial space industry and create scope for private sector investment into space assets, the government enacted the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act in 2015. 39\nThe US National Space Policy, 2020 emphasises on encouraging private space entrepreneurship and innovation in order to preserve the American edge in space operations. The US government seeks to actively identify and invest in commercial technologies that can contribute to the State-led space projects. They do not want to inhibit or compete with the private sector. The government will take it upon itself to develop space systems only when there are no viable options for procurement in the commercial space sector and/or in the interest of national security. The government will be inventive and non-traditional in the process of acquiring commercial space goods and services.40\nThis is evident in NASA’s Artemis program, a key characteristic of it being its industry partners.41 In an effort to build autonomy and competence of its industry, NASA bought end-to-end space services rather than hardware from the space companies.42 43 44\nGiven the strategic imperative of space and the USA’s reliance on the private sector in this regard, the government wants to provide a fillip to the American space companies to stay in the US. The government will also safeguard the companies against predatory foreign investment to retain strategic ownership within the country.\nThe U.S. Space Force Commercial Space Strategy is also in direct support of the U.S. National Space Policy, as are the Department of Defense (DoD) Commercial Space Integration Strategy (2024), United States Novel Space Sector Authorisation and Supervision Framework (2023), and United States Space Priorities Framework (2021).45"

One of the major principles of the new space policy is to maximise procurement from the private sector.46\nJapan became the fourth country to implement a Space Resource Act in 2021 allowing the private entities to explore, extract, and utilise resources in outer space, including water, minerals, and other natural resources existing in outer space. This legislation is expected to spur private investment and development in the space sector.47\nIn 2023, Japan set up a $6.7 Billion, 10-year fund for the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). JAXA will invest in budding space startups and technologies that can take a long time to bear commercial fruit.48"

One of the key goals is to develop local capabilities in the space technology value chain.51\nDue to the lack of technical skill and know-how given that the foray into space in very recent, the UAE has focussed on setting up an suitable regulatory environment, infrastructure and financial assistance to attract space startups into the country. There are express permits for certain space activities. The UAE has established several dedicated space-tech hubs under the Space Economic Zones Program. These hubs aim to provide the private industry with necessary infrastructure, business-friendly environment and investment opportunities.52"

Cases of incongruous roles still exist.\nIN-SPACe is currently responsible for promoting, enabling, authorising as well as supervising the space sector.53 These tasks are incongruous and should not be done by a single entity. The government must consider splitting IN-SPACe’s various directorates into regulatory and promotional groups to avoid conflicts of interest amongst them in the course of their duties.\nSimilar incongruity exists in NSIL also. NSIL acts as a promoter as well as a service provider. In the due course of its duties of advancing the private industry, a scenario is likely to emerge where the private industry may become NSIL’s competitors."

This technology represents not just a backup system but a transformative approach to internet provision.\nSatellite megaconstellations mark a new age in space-based internet.

This ‘internet in the sky’ has democratised satellite internet access.\nSatellite internet has applications across many domains - military operations, disaster response, healthcare services, agricultural productivity, transportation, and public services. The inherently dual-use nature of satellite internet technology—serving both civilian and military purposes—creates complex security dynamics.\nThe potential and risks of satellite internet highlight the need for strategic investments. It is also important to integrate their use in disaster response protocols and leverage their potential to bridge the digital divide. Finally, it is necessary to establish regulation to tackle security concerns and engage in international forums to shape the technology’s future.\nThis document represents the first in a planned series examining satellite internet.

    "text": "5. Policy for Use of AI\nPrinciples for the Use of AI at the Takshashila Institution\nVersion 1.0 25th June 2024\nTakshashila Institution permits the responsible use of AI-based tools for research to augment existing research capacities. This includes the use of AI for searching research leads, synthesising information, aid in reasoning, editing written documents, and visualising outputs. Takshashila Institution recommends the following principles for responsible use of AI tools in research:\nAuthors are accountable for the quality of their research The author(s) is/are responsible for the content. AI cannot be considered an author, and the author(s) are accountable for the paper’s compliance with academic standards of originality, accuracy, plagiarism and attribution to primary sources.\nTransparency Author(s) should declare the use of AI tools in the final output. Where possible, authors should declare the methodology employed while using AI tools. The outlining of research methodology is mandatory when AI is used to support the analyses of the research. If an LLM is used merely as a replacement for Google search, it will not be disclosed\nSamples of how disclosures can be written: The essay was copy-edited using ChatGPT. This data/chart was created using tool X. The analysis in this paper was done with the support of chatGPT.\nAttribution Author(s) will not use AI to write out their analyses - instead, the role of the AI is to improve research productivity by reducing time spent on searching for leads. The author(s) is/are expected to use this information to come to their independent conclusions and write those in their own words. All original sources of information should be correctly cited. Author(s) will verify all information and sources generated using AI tool(s).\nAudit Trail Takshashila Institution recommends it as a best practice to maintain a record of prompts used as part of a project’s research work. This record does not need to be published, but can be used to audit the claims of a document if necessary."

    "section": "Why, What and What Next",
    "text": "Why, What and What Next\nIndia’s problems are scaling faster than the attempted solutions. In every country there is a governance gap—between the economy and its governance—but in our country, the problem is severe, acute and worsening. From telecommunications to finance, from education to agriculture, every sector of the economy needs both specialist domain expertise and management skills. To the extent that India is unable to inject these in its government agencies, it is obvious that we will continue to suffer not only poor governance, but also corruption and injustice.\nAt Takshashila, we have made it our mission to change this. We are acutely aware that the race we are running is marathon, that we will have to run it for decades and the chances that we will succeed are uncertain. Yet, it is a race we have to run.\nWe want to build one of the best schools of statecraft in India. It will be school that is as rooted in India’s civilisational values as it is global in its outlook. It will aim to bring together the best minds in public policy to impart customised, high-quality education to the most promising graduate students. That’s the vision. We have a sense of how to get there, but we do not want start the school tomorrow morning. Since it is to be a school rooted in the Indian experience, we want to scan the length and breadth of the country and build the body of knowledge first.\nYes, this is an audacious project for a bunch of people most of who did not even have greying temples when we started out (and most do not have them even now). So we want to earn our stripes—build credibility even as we validate our own assumptions—by establishing Takshashila as a networked think tank. This is the first step towards realising our vision of an outstanding Indian school of statecraft.\nIt is far more effective to connect talented individuals passionate about changing India for the better into a networked community, than to attempt to hire them and put them in the same building. We do not have the budget for it, and even if we did, we would still stick to the networked model, because we believe it is far more suited to the twenty-first century. [See the Takshashila mission for more details]\nThanks to a substantial initial donation from Rohini Nilekani, chairperson of Arghyam, we could start much faster than we otherwise could.\nSo that’s the preamble. This year was our year zero—the year we got off the ground.\nWe launched our policy research programme and by January 2011, we expect to have more than a dozen fellows. A number of bright younger people have joined us as research associates. Fellows and research associates are spread across the globe, have day jobs and collaborate with each other over the Internet.\nOur Executive Programme on Strategic Affairs (TEPSA) was got off to a start in December 2009, with a full-day programme for senior defence officials, in partnership with the National Maritime Foundation. TEPSA partners educational institutions, think tanks and private companies to train executives on public policy subjects. We will be doing more of these in 2011.\nWe inaugurated our Roundtable Conclave programme last month. Here the idea is to engage civil society by moving high-quality public policy discussions out from New Delhi into the towns and cities of India. We started in Bangalore, and intend to take the programme into other places over the next several months. The idea is to connect individuals who are interested in public affairs to be part of an informed and influential national community.\nAll this, of course, is in addition to our online initiatives at the Indian National Interest (INI) platform of blogs and on twitter. From the time we started, popularity and site traffic has never been our objective. We just wanted to put out the most credible, non-partisan opinion on what we think is in India’s national interest. And we will continue doing so.\nPragati – The Indian National Interest Review, a monthly magazine we started in April 2007, and which Rajeev Mantri’s Quill Media has been distributing print copies of since October 2009, is now into its 46th issue. Like at Takshashila and INI in general, Pragati has attracted a fantastic team of energetic, passionate and committed individuals, and great set of contributors, all working pro bono. From the editorial team to individual contributors, nobody gets paid. Yet Pragati has become one of India’s most well-regarded publications on strategic affairs, public policy and governance. In 2011, we want to increase the circulation of both the digital PDF edition and of the printed copies.\nSince August 2010, I have personally been working on the Takshashila initiative on a full-time basis, thanks to a good friend’s personal sponsorship. I have been fortunate to receive encouragement from a number of people who saw value in what we are trying to achieve. Even so, such a step would be impossible if not for both the support and reality checks imposed on me by my wife…and well, by my children.\nTakshashila needs your help in every one of the areas I’ve written about. We need financial support to build our endowment fund so that we can hire the best graduate students to work on cutting-edge policy research. We need organisers and volunteers across the country to help organise our roundtable conclaves. We need you to subscribe to Pragati, take out gift subscriptions and in general spread the word around.\nIt’s about building an institution that will last. It’s about being a lighthouse that will provide direction to all ships that are willing to navigate by its beacon. Two-and-half millennia ago Takshashila was the intellectual fountainhead not only of Indian statecraft but indeed of all walks of human endeavour. It’s about creating one for modern India."

    "text": "Version 1.0 25th June 2024\nTakshashila Institution permits the responsible use of AI-based tools for research to augment existing research capacities. This includes the use of AI for searching research leads, synthesising information, aid in reasoning, editing written documents, and visualising outputs. Takshashila Institution recommends the following principles for responsible use of AI tools in research:\n\nAuthors are accountable for the quality of their research\nThe author(s) is/are responsible for the content. AI cannot be considered an author, and the author(s) are accountable for the paper’s compliance with academic standards of originality, accuracy, plagiarism and attribution to primary sources.\n\n\nTransparency\nThe author(s) is/are responsible for the content. AI cannot be considered an author, and the author(s) are accountable for the paper’s compliance with academic standards of originality, accuracy, plagiarism and attribution to primary sources.\n\n\nSamples of how disclosures can be written\n\nThe essay was copy-edited using ChatGPT.\n\nThis data/chart was created using tool X.\nThe analysis in this paper was done with the support of chatGPT.\n\n\n\nAttribution\nAuthor(s) will not use AI to write out their analyses - instead, the role of the AI is to improve research productivity by reducing time spent on searching for leads. The author(s) is/are expected to use this information to come to their independent conclusions and write those in their own words. All original sources of information should be correctly cited.\nAuthor(s) will verify all information and sources generated using AI tool(s).\n\n\nAudit Trail\nTakshashila Institution recommends it as a best practice to maintain a record of prompts used as part of a project’s research work. This record does not need to be published, but can be used to audit the claims of a document if necessary."

    "text": "About the State of AI Governance Report\nThe rapid progression in artificial intelligence capabilities has far-reaching impacts. It has the potential to significantly boost economic productivity, disrupt labour markets, and alter the balance of power between countries. The widespread diffusion of this general-purpose technology presents significant governance challenges that are amplified by the ongoing geopolitical competition for AI dominance.\nIt is against this backdrop that the Takshashila Institution, an independent centre for research and education in public policy, presents its inaugural State of AI Governance Report. This report provides a systematic comparative analysis of AI governance approaches across different countries, revealing their strategic priorities. Further, the effectiveness of corporate self-regulation initiatives, and the progress of multistakeholder collaborative efforts are also analysed. It concludes by offering predictions in these areas in the coming year.\nThis annual report will track key developments, analyse trends and offer informed predictions for the AI governance environment. It is intended to provide policymakers, analysts, and interested citizens with insights that help navigate the evolving AI governance landscape.

    "text": "Executive Summary\nThis report analyses AI governance in three contexts – countries, companies and multistakeholder gatherings.\n\nCountries\n\nBeing at the forefront of AI innovation, the US favours a pro-market regulatory environment while prioritising geopolitical considerations to maintain its competitive advantage.\nThe EU has focused on creating a comprehensive regulatory framework that prioritises transparency, accountability, and the protection of individual rights.\nChina’s approach prioritises national security and favours heavy state control in enforcing regulations and driving innovation.\nIndia has opted for a light-touch regulatory environment while investing in developing Indigenous AI models for Indian use cases.\n\n\n\nCompanies\n\nMany companies are proactively establishing principles, guardrails and transparency and disclosure norms that guide how they build or use AI. These initiatives sometimes go beyond what is strictly expected by the regulatory environment in which they operate and are intended to build trust with users.\nHowever, reporting on AI governance efforts by companies is not standardised, and the details of specific initiatives vary considerably. It is also unclear to what extent these efforts involve meaningful external scrutiny. The report analyses the governance initiatives of a few companies operating at different parts of the AI value chain.\n\n\n\nMultistakeholder Gatherings\n\nVarious multistakeholder gatherings, such as the AI Summits and the Global Partnership on AI, have been formed to raise awareness and coordinate AI governance efforts among different countries.\nAlthough most of these groupings do not have binding commitments or backing from all members (for instance, the US and EU refusing refused to sign the declaration on inclusive and sustainable AI at the AI Action Summit in February 2025). However, they serve as a platform to highlight important concerns and drive convergence in AI governance efforts.\n\nFinally, the report ends with some predictions on what we can expect in AI governance in the coming year."

    "section": "Analysis of AI Governance Measures Across Countries",
    "text": "Analysis of AI Governance Measures Across Countries\nAI governance measures often address multiple objectives. These include ensuring transparency and accountability, promoting innovation, addressing geopolitical considerations, enabling state capacity to implement the measures, and promoting societal well-being.\nThe authors have analysed and compared the country-specific AI governance measures across these different criteria. There is some subjectivity in this comparative analysis, but the authors feel it is a useful representation of how countries are pursuing these different AI governance priorities.\nThe United States of America, the European Union, China, and India are selected as countries/regions for comparison. These have been chosen for their significant role in influencing the path of innovation, governance or adoption of AI.\n\n\n\nComparison of AI Governance Measures Across Countries\n\n\nA description of the different criteria is provided below:\n\nTransparency and Accountability: Assesses the extent to which governance frameworks attempt to promote transparency and accountability. This includes examining governance instruments such as evaluation and disclosure requirements, licensing requirements, penalties for non-compliance, and grievance redressal mechanisms.\nPromotion of Innovation: Evaluates how regulations foster innovation by creating an enabling environment. This includes examining the quantum of funding for AI infrastructure, restrictions on market participation, education and skilling initiatives and maturity of the R&D ecosystem.\nGeopolitical Considerations: This assesses the extent to which policy decisions address geopolitical priorities. It includes assessing whether a state can secure access to the building blocks of AI and deny access to other countries. Relevant policy measures include export controls, investments in domestic infrastructure, promotion of open-source technologies, and policies that reduce vulnerabilities in the value chain.\nSocietal Wellbeing: Assesses how regulations address broader societal concerns, such as protecting individuals from risks and harms from the adoption of AI in various sectors, and reducing environmental costs associated with AI.\nState Capacity to Govern: An estimation of the financial resources, institutional frameworks, and skilled human capital being created to enforce compliance with AI regulations effectively.\n\n\nAnalysis of AI Governance Measures in the U.S.\n\nThe US regulatory approach utilizes existing regulatory capacity, supplementing it with AI-specific considerations.\nFederal AI regulation in the US involves executive orders setting goals, agency rulemaking enacting specifics (such as by the NIST, DOE, DOJ and HHS), and independent agency actions within their sectors.\nSeveral US states have implemented their own AI-specific regulations focusing on consumer protection, privacy, transparency, and algorithmic discrimination.\nPresident Trump’s Executive Order on Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI has revoked President Biden’s EO 14110, that might lead to changes in federal AI regulations.\n\n\nTransparency & Accountability\n\nCompared to the EU, the US currently scores lower on transparency and accountability in AI governance partly due to the revocation of EO 14110 that had mandated disclosure for large foundational models and tasked NIST with developing safety testing standards.\nThe OMB Act mandates risk management standards for AI use in identified high-risk government systems. The DOE is evaluating tools for identifying AI model risks in critical areas like nuclear and biological threats.\n\n\n\nPromotion of Innovation\n\nThe US strongly focuses on promoting AI innovation, with President Trump’s executive order aiming to remove barriers to global AI dominance.\nSome initiatives from EO 14110 are expected to continue, such as NIST’s NAIRR project and the OMB mandate for open-sourcing government AI models and data by default.\nThe DOE will likely continue streamlining approvals for allied AI infrastructure like power and data centers.\nNIST’s risk management framework and the US Patent Office’s guidance on AI patentability will drive standardization and innovation.\n\n\n\nGeopolitical Considerations\n\nGeopolitics is a significant focus in US AI regulation due to its leadership and competition with China.\nThe US aims to maintain a competitive edge by controlling access to AI chips through the AI diffusion framework.\nA monitoring regime is in place for large AI model training runs on US Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), including reporting by international customers.\nThe US Treasury prohibits certain financial transactions involving high-risk AI systems.\nSecurity agencies are tasked with identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities across the AI supply chain.\n\n\n\nSocietal Wellbeing\n\nSeveral US states have enacted AI-specific regulations to prevent algorithmic discrimination, ensure disclosure, and label AI-generated content.\nState privacy laws have been updated to address the use of personal information and risks related to AI profiling and consent.\nFederal regulations from OMB and HHS establish standards for AI use in delivering public benefits and within government.\n\n\n\nState Capacity to Govern\n\nThe revocation of EO 14110 creates uncertainty around current US AI governance rules.\nRegulations focusing on building AI infrastructure, capital flows, and talent are expected to remain relatively stable.\nRegulations concerning AI governance capacity building, transparency, and auditability are likely to be reviewed and potentially rolled back.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of AI Governance Measures in the E.U.\n\nThe EU AI Act establishes comprehensive regulatory guidelines for AI systems operating within the European Union.\nIt interacts with other regulations like the GDPR, DMA, DSA, Chips Act, and Cyber Resilience Act, that collectively influence the operations entities involved in the manufacture, deployment, import or distribution of AI systems.\n\n\nTransparency & Accountability\n\nThe EU has the most comprehensive measures for AI transparency and accountability, including risk tiering, evaluations, disclosure, licensing, penalties, and input controls.\nAI systems in the EU are classified into unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal risk categories, with corresponding compliance obligations.\n\n\n\nPromotion of Innovation\n\nWhile compliance with the comprehensive regulations creates hurdles, there are provisions for promoting standards and regulatory sandboxes to facilitate adherence.\nThe InvestAI initiative aims to mobilise $216 bn for open and collaborative development of complex AI models in Europe.\nThe EU AI Act includes carve-outs to lessen the impact of penalties on SMEs and startups.\n\n\n\nGeopolitical Considerations\n\nStrategic autonomy and technology sovereignty have gained prominence in EU AI policy discussions.\nThe InvestAI initiative funds the open development of complex AI models, including AI gigafactories for data centers and the creation of datasets.\nThe EU Chips Act involves significant investment to enhance competitiveness and resilience in the semiconductor industry.\nThe EU AI Act includes exceptions for AI models released under free and open-source licenses.\n\n\n\nSocietal Wellbeing\n\nAmong the regions compared in this report, the EU has the most comprehensive measures to address societal wellbeing through various governance instruments such as tiering, evaluation and performance requirements, disclosure mandates, licensing and certifications, penalties and input controls\nVoluntary codes of conduct are encouraged for assessing and minimising the environmental impact of AI systems.\n\n\n\nState Capacity to Govern\n\nThe EU AI Act mandates the creation of governance institutions at both the EU and member state levels for implementation.\nThis includes the establishment of the EU AI Office, advised by a scientific panel of independent experts.\nMember states are required to establish their own institutions to enforce compliance with the EU AI Act regulations.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of AI Governance Measures in China\n\nChina’s AI governance framework is a comprehensive, state-driven approach across multiple dimensions.\nThe system prioritizes centralized control through proactive regulation requiring algorithm transparency, security assessments, ethics reviews, and content monitoring aligned with state objectives.\nChina’s governance model emphasizes public-private collaboration for AI innovation along with strategic state investments.\nChina’s governance strategy strongly reflects national security priorities through data sovereignty measures, indigenous computing development and military-civil fusion initiatives.\nMassive financial investments such as $140 bn from the Bank of China and $184 bn in government VC funding are announced for AI firms.\n\n\nTransparency & Accountability\n\nChina’s state-enforced AI regulations demonstrate a preference for proactive, centralised governance.\nChinese regulations mandate algorithm filing, transparency, security assessments, and ethics reviews before AI deployment.\nWatermarking for AI-generated content and complaint redressal mechanisms are also required in China.\n\n\n\nPromotion of Innovation\n\nChina’s governance mechanisms focus on state-driven public-private collaboration and strategic infrastructure development for innovation.\nThere is a strong emphasis on AI talent cultivation and public-private research partnerships in China, including innovation hubs supported by AI-focused education guidelines and university-affiliated research centers.\nGuidelines reinforce an open AI ecosystem, promoting resource-sharing, interoperability, and common technical standards.\nLarge-scale infrastructure projects ensure regional computing power distribution and provide tax incentives for AI infrastructure investments.\n\n\n\nGeopolitical Considerations\n\nPolicies emphasise technological self-sufficiency through measures requiring data sovereignty, AI security, indigenous computing infrastructure development and military-civil fusion.\nStrict data localization measures are imposed, requiring government approval for cross-border transfers of “important data.”\nMandatory algorithmic filing and real-time content monitoring ensure AI-generated content aligns with state narratives.\nReal-name verification requirements under cybersecurity laws address information control and foreign influence concerns.\n\n\n\nSocietal Wellbeing\n\nA state-led approach focuses on AI ethics, data privacy, content moderation, and digital fairness.\nExplicit user consent for personal data usage and mandatory opt-out options for personalised recommendations are required.\nAlgorithmic price discrimination is banned, and watermarking/labeling of AI-generated content is mandated.\nExplicit user consent is required for use of voices and images in synthetic media.\n\n\n\nState Capacity to Govern\n\nChina’s capacity to govern AI development is demonstrated through massive financial investments and centralised infrastructure planning.\nThe government directs significant capital into priority AI sectors at an unprecedented scale.\nLocal governments have also dedicated billions to AI research and infrastructure, reflecting a decentralised but state-coordinated funding approach.\nStrong oversight is provided by government institutions like the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).\nThe state has the capacity to fund and manage large-scale computing networks for AI development.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of AI Governance Measures in India\n\nIndia’s AI governance is characterised by limited regulations, with sector-specific guidelines in finance and health.\nThe government is promoting AI innovation through the IndiaAI Mission addressing priority use cases such as agriculture, education and healthcare.\nSome policy interventions aim to address vulnerabilities related to access to AI resources.\nThere is a lack of comprehensive regulations in India for managing the broad risks associated with AI.The draft AI Governance Guidelines propose a Technical Secretariat to enhance state capacity to govern AI, but its implementation is uncertain.\n\n\nTransparency & Accountability\n\nIndia has limited cross-sector regulations. The finance and health sectors in India have more specific regulations and AI safety guidelines.The RBI has formed a panel to review AI regulation in finance, identify risks, and recommend a compliance framework. Similarly, ICMR Ethical Guidelines provide principles for AI development and deployment in healthcare.\nThe AI Advisory (2024) recommends labeling deepfake and synthetic content, and draft guidelines suggest voluntary incident reporting.\n\n\n\nPromotion of Innovation\n\nThe IndiaAI Mission has allocated over $1.2 bn to develop AI models, datasets, compute, and education.\nEfforts are underway to enable access to compute resources and datasets through portals like IndiaAI Compute and AIKosha.\nWhile aiming to encourage startups and MSMEs, the implementation of these innovation initiatives may face inefficiencies.\n\n\n\nGeopolitical Considerations\n\nThe US AI Diffusion Framework’s export controls could potentially restrict India’s access to computing resources and advanced AI models.\nIndia is attempting to mitigate these risks by promoting indigenous AI models and domestic computing clusters.\n\n\n\nSocietal Wellbeing\n\nSector-specific guidelines from ICMR and RBI, along with the AI Advisory (2024), offer a voluntary ethical framework for societal well-being in AI.\nThere are currently no overarching regulations in India to address the diverse risks posed by AI technologies.\n\n\n\nState Capacity to Govern\n\nMeitY’s draft AI Governance Guidelines propose a Technical Secretariat to monitor and mitigate AI risks and harms in real-time, serving as a bridge between the industry and policymakers.\nAs these are draft guidelines, it remains to be seen how state capacity will be enhanced to implement them."

    "text": "Analysis of AI Governance Measures Across Companies\nCompanies are proactively adopting AI governance measures. These measures include developing AI principles, implementing risk mitigation strategies, enhancing transparency and establishing governance structures.\nHowever, there is currently a lack of standardization in how companies report on their AI governance efforts. The specific details of company AI governance initiatives vary considerably.\nThe extent of meaningful external scrutiny of company AI governance efforts is unclear. It is also challenging to understand how companies are operationalizing their principles, measuring the effectiveness of their risk mitigation strategies, and ensuring accountability.\nMicrosoft, Google, OpenAI, Mistral, Anthropic, Amazon, Accenture, and Deloitte are selected for the comparative analysis. These companies operate across different stages of the AI value chain, including big technology platforms, AI model developers, and technology services firms.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of AI Governance Measures Across Companies\n\n\n\nPrinciples\nThe extent to which the organisation’s responsible AI policy is articulated and identifies the principles it seeks to adhere to. A comparison of the articulation of principles on responsible AI development and use by different companies is provided below.\n\nMicrosoft: In 2018, six ethical principles were adopted: accountability, transparency, fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, and inclusiveness. These principles have been translated into corporate policies, including a standard for engineering teams.\nGoogle: First published in 2018 and updated recently, the principles are bold innovation, responsible development and deployment, and collaborative progress.\nOpenAI: Committed to building safe and beneficial AGI. Specific principles are not detailed. Its usage policy prohibits uses such as biometric profiling, deceptive techniques, harm to children, etc.\nMistral: Mistral’s responsible AI policy emphasises key principles such as neutrality, empowerment, building trust and minimising potential harm and misuse. Furthermore, its terms of use emphasise data privacy and security and restrict access to individuals under 13.\nAnthropic: Anthropic emphasizes proportional safeguards that scale with the potential risks of AI systems. Their approach is inspired by biosafety standards, ensuring that safety measures align with the capabilities of their models.\nAmazon: AWS has introduced an updated Responsible AI Policy in January, 2025, which supplements the AWS Acceptable Use Policy and AWS Service Terms. This policy outlines a set of prohibited actions, and includes commitments to developing safe, fair, and accurate AI and machine learning services.\nAccenture: Accenture’s four pillars of responsible AI implementation are: Organizational, Operational, Technical, and Reputational.\nDeloitte: Uses a Trustworthy AI™ framework to help organizations develop ethical safeguards across seven key dimensions: transparent and explainable, fair and impartial, robust and reliable, respectful of privacy, safe and secure, responsible, and accountable.\n\n\n\nRisk Mitigation\nThe extent to which policy identifies the potential risks and lists actions to mitigate against those risks. The risk mitigation efforts by different companies are listed below:\n\nMicrosoft: AI risk management is part of the company’s enterprise risk management system. They also prioritise development of open-access responsible AI tools to map, measure and manage risks.\nGoogle: Work with external organizations to establish boundaries and reduce the risks of abuse.

    "text": "Analysis of AI Governance Measures Across Multistakeholder Groupings\nVarious multistakeholder gatherings, including the AI Summits and the Global Partnership on AI, have been established to raise awareness and coordinate international AI governance efforts.\nWhile state-level efforts have tended to focus on innovation and geopolitics, multistakeholder gatherings highlight broader societal concerns arising from the rapid development of advanced AI.\nMost gatherings do not have legally binding commitments or backing from all members (for instance, the US and EU refusing refused to sign the declaration on inclusive and sustainable AI at the AI Action Summit in February 2025).\nAchieving alignment or convergence on AI regulations through these platforms can simplify compliance for multinational technology companies.\nThe analysis in this section focuses on the membership composition, guiding principles, and recent developments in these gatherings.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\nMembership: - OECD has 38 member countries committed to democracy, collaborating on addressing global policy changes, and is not an AI-specific body.\nPrinciples and areas of focus: - OECD promotes inclusive growth, human-centric values, transparency and explainability, robustness and accountability of AI systems. - The OECD AI Principles are the first intergovernmental standard on AI.\n\n\nGlobal Partnership on AI\nMembership: - GPAI has 44 member countries, including the US, EU, UK, Japan, and India.\nPrinciples and areas of focus: - GPAI promotes the responsible development of AI grounded in human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation, and economic growth - Areas of focus include responsible AI, data governance, the future of work, and innovation and commercialisation.\nDevelopments: - As of 2024, GPAI and the OECD formally joined forces to combine their work on AI and implement human-centric, safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. The two bodies are committed to implementing the OECD Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\nAI Governance Alliance\nMembership: - The AI governance alliance is a global initiative launched by the World Economic Forum. The alliance has over 603 members from more than 500 organisations globally.\nPrinciples and areas of focus: - The principles of the AI Governance Alliance include responsible and ethical AI, inclusivity, transparency, international collaboration and multistakeholder engagement. - The areas of focus include safe systems and technologies, responsible applications and transformation, resilient governance and regulation.\n\n\nAI Summits\nMembership: - The AI summits are a series of international conferences addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by AI. Participants include heads of state and major companies such as Meta and DeepMind.\nPrinciples and areas of focus: - Each AI summit has set its own agenda, but some common principles are ethical AI development, safety and security, transparency and accountability, and international collaboration. - The AI Summits have been held thrice since their inception. The first summit, focussing on AI safety, was held at Bletchley Park in the UK in 2023. The second summit was held in Seoul, South Korea, in 2024. - The third event, the AI Action Summit was held in Paris in February 2025 and was attended by representatives from more than 100 countries. While 58 countries, including France, China and India, signed a joint declaration, the US and UK refused to sign the declaration on inclusive and sustainable AI. - The agenda has evolved from existential risks and global cooperation at Bletchley, to risk management frameworks and company commitments at Seoul to an action oriented focus on public interest, sustainability and global governance at Paris.\n\n\nUnited Nations\nMembership: - The UN is an international organisation committed to global peace and security, with 193 member states, including almost all internationally-recognised sovereign states. The safe development of AI is one of their many areas of work.\nPrinciples and areas of focus: - Some of their core principles include doing no harm. AI applications should have a clear purpose, fairness and non-discrimination, safety and security to prevent misuse and harm, responsibility and accountability. - The UN Secretary-General is convening a multi-stakeholder High-level Advisory Body on AI to study and provide recommendations for the international governance of AI. - Other efforts include convening global dialogues, developing standards and building capacity.\n\n\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\nMembership: - UNESCO is a specialised agency of the UN with 194 member states and 12 associate member states\nPrinciples and areas of focus: - The UNESCO general conference adopted the recommendation on the ethics of artificial intelligence – the first global standard on AI ethics principles aligned with the UN’s principles on AI. - Areas of focus include developing an AI Readiness Assessment Methodology, facilitating policy dialogues and capacity building initiatives."

The effectiveness of these thresholds might be challenged as a measure of capability as inference computing begins to scale and smaller models become more efficient. The US and EU have 10^26 and 10^25 flops as training compute thresholds for enforcing certain regulations.\n\n\nHigh\nGlobal\nInvestments in sovereign cloud infrastructure will increase, driven by geopolitical considerations.\n\n\nHigh\nChina, EU\nOpen-source and open-weight models will continue to be pushed by China and EU as a pathway to strategic autonomy and technology leadership. DeepSeek and Mistral will remain open-weight or open-source.\n\n\nHigh\nIndia\nThe compute capacity created under the IndiaAI mission aimed towards incentivising startups and building indigenous models will be underutilised. This is due to lack of demand that meets the criteria to qualify for the subsidies as well as due to friction in the bureaucratic process involved.\n\n\nModerate\nGlobal\nAI governance regulations at the state level will continue to prioritise innovation over encouraging transparency, accountability, and societal well-being. In other words geopolitical considerations will trump protection of individual rights as a governance priority.\n\n\nModerate\nUS\nUS chip restrictions on China will not escalate further. This is because Deep Seek makes owning newer chips less relevant.\n\n\nModerate\nUS\nFederal laws focused on monitoring AI safety and federal agency assessment of AIs for discrimination and bias will be made defunct or watered down significantly. By the end of the year, AI safety guardrails will be driven by private firms.\n\n\nModerate\nEU\nEU’s comprehensive regulatory framework, including penalties for non-compliance, would result in a few companies not releasing their AI models/features in the EU. This might lead to a milder enforcement of the regulations. As per the declared timeline, rules on notified bodies, general purpose AI models, governance, confidentiality, and penalties start to apply from August, 2025.\n\n\nModerate\nChina\nThe US Diffusion Framework will not stop state-of-the-art AI models coming out of China, at least not in the next year. This is because Deep Seek makes owning newer chips less relevant, and China has built up an overcapacity of data centres over the past few years.\n\n\nModerate\nIndia\nRegulatory focus will be on protecting the information ecosystem from content deemed harmful for the government or Indian society.\n\n\nModerate\nCorporate\nGovernance of AI within companies will become a bigger requirement as governments firm up on their positions regarding AI. ‘Chief Responsible AI Officer’ will be a new role at companies seeking to deploy AI solutions at scale, whose duty it will be to ensure AI is deployed in a manner that will, at the very least, protect them from litigation.\n\n\n\nConfidence reflects how likely the authors believe their prediction will be accurate in the coming year."

    "text": "About the Book\nAfter a brief interlude following the Cold War, nuclear weapons have regained their prominent place in world affairs. Yet our current nuclear age will not be a replay of the Cold War. New technologies, changing political contexts and the death of old arms-control agreements mean that today’s nuclear strategists have to navigate unchartered waters filled with fresh perils. Unfortunately, the consequences of failure in the nuclear world can be catastrophic. The immediate imperative today is to lower the possibility of nuclear weapons use during a crisis or conflict involving nuclear powers. While deliberate or pre-emptive nuclear use is less likely, the rising danger of our time is that nuclear weapons will be employed due to some combination of miscommunication, misjudgment, misperception and sheer accident.\nThe Sheathed Sword: From Nuclear Brink to No First Use is a collection of essays by leading scholars and practitioners on the role of nuclear weapons in global security. The contributors examine how individual states view nuclear weapons, the devastating effects of nuclear war on the world’s climate and the issues around nuclear no first use. They also debate the feasibility and desirability of a global no-first-use (GNFU) agreement.\n\n\n\nOrder on Amazon\n\n\n\n\nOrder on Flipkart\n\n\n\n\nOrder on Bloomsburry\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Contributors\nColin S.
