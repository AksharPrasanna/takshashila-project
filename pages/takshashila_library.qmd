### Our library

Libraries play an important role in enabling a research based institution like ours to achieve more – to undertake rigorous research, to provide high-quality teaching, to publish and to provide the essential conditions for learning and scholarship to flourish.

It is important that the knowledge gained by research is not trapped at the institute itself, or caught in the language of research, or simply isolated from those who actually apply that knowledge – the practitioners in the field. Likewise, tacit knowledge from the field rarely reaches the researchers or those making decisions. Therefore, more effective bridges between knowledge, policy and practice are needed and this is possible only with establishing communities of practice (CoPs) for all public policy interface. The CoP also is an effective way of engaging researchers, practitioners and students and is key to building a focused approach to public policy development and implementation.
