## About the Programme
Nations are vying for dominance in several critical and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, semiconductors, telecommunications, and cybersecurity to gain strategic advantage. Rivalries between major powers are intensifying as they invest in research and development, IP protection, and industrial policies.

Developing countries like India are also striving to enhance their capabilities. The HTG Programme works on navigating these issues while balancing growth, security, ethics, and international cooperation as crucial factors responsible for shaping the future of emerging technologies, and the geopolitics associated with it.

Our work on formulating a Techno-Strategic Doctrine for India lays out imperatives, objectives, and approaches to thinking about technology and strategy.
