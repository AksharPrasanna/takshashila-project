## Phase 1.0 - Proto-Takshashila

### 2005 - Early Days

Still the internet’s early days. A bunch of like-minded, passionate bloggers come together to create Indian National Interest as a place for serious discussion on foreign affairs and public policy concerning India. They blog about the pressing issues of the time, often under pseudonyms, while working their day jobs.

Many of these bloggers would go on to found the Takshashila Institution.

### 2007 - Pragati: An Indian National Interest Review

The Indian National Interest community quickly realises that India does not have reputable national publications with a global outlook. Their effort gives birth to Pragati, an online magazine, in April 2007.

They describe themselves as “an independent community of individuals committed to increasing public awareness and education on strategic affairs, economic policy and governance.”

### 2008 - Public Policy in India

It’s 2008, and the Indian public policy discourse remains monopolised by vested interests and contained to limited quarters.
Over lunch one day at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, Singapore, Nitin Pai, Anand Sampath and his colleague Srinivasan, come to the realisation that India needs a public policy school that trains students to engage with the modern world in an increasingly connected world, and emerge as civic leaders.
Takshashila would become the pioneer of public policy education in India.

### 2009 - Takshashila is Founded

From a long process of thinking and cogitating, both in the online blogging world and over physical meetings, is born the idea of a networked think tank. Eschewing the brick and mortar traps of its predecessors to function freely in the digital world, it aims to connect smart people all over the world over the internet.

Takshashila is founded in mid-2009 as an independent, non-partisan think tank without political affiliations. It seeks to uphold the values of liberty, open markets, plural and tolerant society, good governance, and promote India’s national interest in order to claim its right as a global power.

Takshashila has multiple founders - in support and in spirit. Nitin Pai, Narayan Ramachandran, Sameer Wagle, Mukul Asher, Anantha Nageswaran, Niranjan Rajadhyaksha, and Anand Sampath come together to co-found Takshashila. Aruna Urs joins as its first employee in Bengaluru.

In October, Rohini Nilekani becomes an establishment donor with a meaningful grant to help Takshashila get off the ground.

### 2010 - Why Do We Do What We Do?

Inspired by the heritage of the ancient Takshashila University, the question in the minds of the founders is: What does a Takshashila of the 21st century look like?

Grappling for answers, Takshashila conducts policy roundtables in Mumbai and Delhi. Shalas - typical unconferences, with an innovative, informal format that blend scheduled presentations with spontaneous, even extempore talks from participants - are also held in Delhi and Pune.

The answer is soon found: Takshashila Institution’s aim is to become an apex establishment with a deep social conscience, situated at the crossroads of ideas and people.

Pragati, meanwhile, moves to a print avatar with the same high quality content on economics, international relations and strategic affairs.

### 2011 - GCPP is Conceived

The founders soon realise that the best route to elevate public discourse is by teaching public policy, civic leadership and public engagement to interested college students and professionals. Takshashila’s destiny as a public policy school takes shape.

A rigorous 12-week course called the Graduate Certificate in Public Policy (GCPP) condensed a full public policy programme into a single semester of intensive learning. It is announced towards the end of the year, and Takshashila’s journey as a pioneer in public policy education in India is well on its way.


## Phase 2.0 Yellappa Chetty

### 2012 - Pioneering Public Policy Education in India

Bengaluru narrowly beats Goa as the headquarters of Takshashila, given its critical mass of multidisciplinary talent pool and flowthrough of such talent. Takshashila finds its first home in Yellappa Chetty Layout, Bengaluru - a nice house tucked inside a quiet green neighbourhood.

The first batch of GCPP starts in January with 25 students. The batch includes Saurabh Chandra, Sameer Wagle, Pavan Srniath, Vasanth Shetty, Revendra T, Sarah Farooqi, Priyadarshini Ravichandran, Sachin Kalbag and others, who continued to be associated with Takshashila in different capacities.

From Day One, GCPP classes are conducted fully online. It remains so, with changes in the tools, tech and LMS platforms used every couple of years.

The first GCPP physical workshop is held in Delhi, followed by Goa. GCPP is now offered thrice a year.
